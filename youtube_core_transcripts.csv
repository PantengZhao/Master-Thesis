#aitools #aiwebsites #ai #aidesign #aiforbusiness #aiforbeginners",AI tools for content creation,1614,75,14,2025-09,"Hey friends, welcome back. So, I spent almost $20,000 on testing hundreds of AI tools in the past 2 months, and I finally found the ones that are actually useful for your business when it comes to content creation and digital marketing. So, I'm going to save you 20 grand today by sharing every single one of them in today's video. And to make things easier for you, I've timestamped each category and linked all of the tools in the description. So, let's dive in. [Music] First on my list is Similar Web. This is hands down one of the most powerful AI platforms for digital marketing. And honestly, if you run a business nowadays without this, you're most likely going to lose to your competitors because this platform allows you to literally dig into all of your competitors marketing strategies so you know exactly what's working and not working for them. Here's how it works. Just enter yours and your competitor's website on similar web. Now, you can dig through every paid video ads your competitors are running and see exactly how much they're spending and how efficient their ads are and even their messaging. That way, you can spot what's working for them and sharpen your unique selling point to stand out. And you can also see which traffic sources are driving their growth like paid search or display. So, you can adjust your strategy to either match their moves or outsmart them entirely. You can even stack your own website's traffic and engagement next to theirs, and if they're outperforming you, then you know exactly where to close the gaps. Competitive analysis is not the only thing that Similar Web is good at. For example, you can do keyword research, market research, lead generation, and they also have very powerful AI feature. One of my favorites is the Gen AI intelligence. It literally lets you track how much traffic you and your competitors are getting from AI platforms like ChatGpt or Perplexity. And it even lets you know which prompts people are typing that leads them to your website. This is an insane platforms for any marketers, entrepreneurs, business owners, and just honestly a marketing cheat code. And you can try it out for free. I've linked similar web in the description. So definitely check it out. All right, before I show you the next tool, let me show you something. [Music] These are all AI generated videos created by this one platform called Runway ML. This is one of the most powerful AI video generators out there. I know you might be thinking, okay, that's cool, but why do I need AI videos for my business? Well, that might be true like 2 years ago, but nowadays businesses can actually do a lot with AI videos, and it's becoming more and more relevant. for example, product ads, training videos, explainer content, or even an entire storytelling campaign. And you can do all of that without blowing on your marketing budget. And all you need to do is just type in what you want on Runway ML, and it's going to generate exactly what you need. You can also use the act 2 feature to animate any characters you want by just uploading videos of yourself and it will create the most realistic animations without your company hiring expensive VFX artists. And with their newest Alive feature, you can do even more. For example, you can add things to the scene, generate new camera angles, remove things from the scene, change objects in the scene, or even alter a character's appearance. So yeah, there's just so much you can do with Runway. I remember when I first heard about Runway like 2 years ago, I was like, hm, I don't know the point of this and the output wasn't even that good. And now all of a sudden, I'm seeing more and more creators and companies are using this and I know that the tech is only going to get better from this point, which is why I think now is the best time to learn about this so your business can get ahead of the curve. You can try it out for free if you just wanted to experiment with it. But if you're planning to make more than a few videos, then I think the pay plans will be totally worth it. [Music] All right, next is Google V3. [Music] This is Google's newest and most powerful AI video generator, and it's insane. Now, even though Runway ML can create some pretty cool looking videos, but V3 is absolutely killing it when it comes to creating that super realistic cinematic videos. And every time when I scroll past one of those videos generated by V3, I'm like, how these are made by AI? And it's so realistic that I'm seeing more and more companies are using V3 to generate like product videos, UGC content, and even fullon commercials. One of the most mind-blowing features of V3 is character consistency. For example, I can upload a single photo of a character, and V3 can generate an entire video of that character doing different things from different angle, all while looking exactly like that character. And so what that means for business is that and you can just save so much money on models, actors, production crews, and video editors. You can just use VO3 to replace it all. So if your business, definitely experiment with it right now and take advantage of their free 1 month trial. All right, now that we got that video generation stuff out of the way, let's move on to AI image generation tools. And I've got two really insane tools for you. And the first one is Midjourney. This is hands down best AI image generation tools out there and is one of the OGs as well. All you need to do just prompt Midjourney of any image style that you want and it will generate the thing for you. So what that means for business is that instead of hiring a photographer or graphic designer, you can just use midjourney to generate things like product mockups, ad concepts, social media visuals, branding mood boards, or even full on marketing campaigns without hiring creative agency, photographer, models, and etc. And one of my favorite features from MidJourney is their omni reference. This lets you blend multiple image reference together so you can get super specific while keeping the same consistent character and styles across all of your images. I like to first use MidJourney's uh existing library for inspiration. Let's say you find a picture from the community feed that you absolutely love. Just right click on it, choose style reference, and then add your own omni reference. For example, it could be a photo of you. Then you need to adjust the omni strength. Now, lower strength means that it sticks more to the style and changes your reference image a lot, and higher strength means that it keeps your original reference almost exactly the same. Personally, I like to keep it around 500. It gives me that perfect balance between keeping my likeness and still transforming the vibe to match the style that I'm going for. Click generate. And there you have it. Now you have these really professional looking photos of that character that looks like you just got them out of a professional photo shoot. And honestly, with what you can do with MidJourney, their pricing, it's super reasonable. With just $10 a month, uh you can do so much with it. To be honest, it's a lot cheaper than hiring a creative agency for just one campaign. Here's another insane AI image generator that's going to blow your mind. Hick View AI. Use this when you need that ultra realistic character consistent images. I've been playing around with it a lot lately. It's scary good. Just look at these images I made of myself using Hicks Field. [Music] Yep, that's all AI. It's not me getting some professional photo shoots. And here's how I use it. Now, first you just need to upload around 20 to 70 photos of yourself following their simple guidelines, different angles, lighting, and expressions. Then, Hicksfield is going to train its model on your face so it really knows what you look like. Now, once that's done, then um you just need to pick a visual style that you like, select your train character, and let the AI generate the most photo realistic images with your exact same face over and over again. The results look so natural that most people can't even tell that these were generated by AI. I swear to you, it's wild. And it's not just for personal use. There's so much potential for business as well. Imagine instead of hiring a model, businesses can just use Hicksfield to create a brand ambassador across every single one of their marketing campaign and they can generate UGC video ads. And the price is quite reasonable as well. It starts with $5 for 80 credits or you can pay a little bit more $80 for 1,700 credits. All right, at this point you're probably thinking, ""Wow, there's so many tools for so many different things. Joanna, is there one that can do both videos and photos?"" I got you. It's called Love Art and it's not just photos or video generation. It's the world's first design AI agent. And honestly, after using this, I've cancel my Canva and Adobe subscription. I'm sorry, but I have to let you guys go. It's got images, graphic design, hyperrealistic videos, and even 3D renderings all in one single platform. I'm going to give you a quick tutorial to demonstrate how it works. Now, for example, let's say if I'm creating a labu coffee brand concept, what I need to do is just type in a single prompt and love art instantly generates everything. Packaging, design, store, interior, merge, even a full website mockup. At this point, it's just image generation, right? Wait, this is where the design part comes in. If you want to tweak just one part, or you can comment to edit certain things without changing the whole design. And if you wanted to turn that image into video, done. And if we want to turn that into a 3D design, done. The reason why I can do all of that in one platform is because Love Arts combines all of the best AI models into one single place. Like V3, Runway, Gen 4, Flux, Context, all of that. So you can really go from a single sketch of an idea to a fullon cinematic brand visuals all in one platform. And again, it's one of those tools that you can just start for free. And for me, giving that it can do so much for you, their pay plan is totally worth it. If you're running a business, chances are you're sitting on hours of unused content. Calls, meetings, webinars, trainings, all of that could and should become your marketing content. Let's be real, nobody really has time to transcribe, summarize, and repurpose all of that. Which is why I'm going to introduce you to the next AI tool, Cast Magic. [Music] Think of it like your content multiplier. And the way that you use it is very simple. Just upload any videos, audio file, Zoom recording, or even just podcast or YouTube link. And within seconds, Cast Magic gives you a clean, accurate transcription. But here's the crazier part. Now, Cast Magic can instantly summarize your recording into clean takeaways, turn it into a LinkedIn post, a tweet or a newsletter draft or repurpose it into YouTube script or Instagram reals idea and it can generate captions and blog post automatically. And these are just 10% of what you can do with cast magic. Basically, this is like your AI content assistant that constantly listens to all of your conversation and hands you 20 pieces of content instantly. And for business, this is a gamecher. It means that you can scale your marketing without scaling your team. Get more ROI from the content that you're already creating. And the most important thing is that you can stay consistent on every platform without burning out. So the price for CM Magic starts at $35 a month for solo creators and small teams, and it goes up for bigger businesses. Try it out. I think it's such a timesaver. [Music] The next one is mind-blowing and useful, and I don't think you're ready for this. Check this out. I'm speaking English to you right now. Right. The crazy part is that this whole time I'm just speaking English and all I did was uploading this video to Han's AI translator and it cloned my voice into different languages that you just heard. Hey Jan is really a game-changing tool for content creators and business owners because all of a sudden language barriers for your content are gone. And this is how I would take full advantage of hey Jan if I have a business. Just open up your audience analytic on any social media platform and see which countries my followers are from and start translating my top content into their languages and boom, you just unlocked a whole new market of audience overnight. Lip sync translation is not the only thing that Hey Jen can do. You can create a spokesperson videos without hiring any models or talent. You can generate product explainer with multiple presenters. And you can scale video content without re-shoots. And the most important thing is you can start for free. And even their pay plan is kind of cheap. It's only like $29 a month, which is a pretty good deal considering how much you can do with this. Now that we covered the content side of your business, but let's be real, content itself doesn't pay the bills. But you know what will? Sales, customers, cash flow. That's where the next AI tool comes in. And honestly, it feels kind of illegal for me to talk about this. Anyways, it's called JVA AI and it might just replace your entire sales team or make them irreplaceable if they know how to use it. This thing, it's a money making machine. It helped this company made an extra $1.2 million revenue. Another one, 800K. And this one, another $3 million more revenue just casually. All of these companies automate their sales using JVA AI. And here's how they did it. First, click new automation inside JVA. Tell the AI who your dream customers are. You can get super specific with filters like job title, industry, company size, or just upload your existing CRM or lead list. Next, create a couple of outreach messages. Or if you're feeling lazy, you can just let AI write them for you using their smart templates that automatically personalize for every single lead. And that's it. From there, you can just chill while Juva AI is doing all the hard work. It finds you the most qualified leads, send them messages, and follow up. And before you know it, you've got prospect practically handed to you on silver platter already warmed up and ready for you to close. It doesn't matter if you're solopreneur, tiny startup, or a big company. If you're not using some sort of AI for your outreach right now, your competitors will, and they're going to beat you to the deal. Now, what if you already have a sales team and you just need a ridiculously powerful database to feed them highquality leads every single day? This is where another AI sales tool comes in. It's called Apollo AI. Apollo really shines on their data. We're talking over 275 million verified contacts and 73 million company profiles with filters so detailed that you can practically find exactly the type of person that you want to talk to. So, here's how it works. You can search for leads using incredibly granular filters. Not just job titles or company size, but things like tech stack, hiring trends, funding rounds, even if they just posted a job that signals that they might need your service. And once you got your dream lead list, you can export it to your CRM, connect it to your outreach software, or even use Apollo's builtin email and LinkedIn automation to start conversations instantly. And because their database is constantly updated, you're not wasting time chasing outdated contacts or dead emails. If you make it all the way here, damn, you have my respect. I hope that you learn a lot today. And most importantly, I hope that you can actually apply one of these tools in your business. Again, all the links to these tools are in the description. And to make things useful for you beyond this video, I've put together a list of my favorite and go-to AI and marketing SAS tools all in one document. And this is a list that I upgrade regularly and I treat it like my personal toolbox and I hope that it's useful for you as well. And I'm giving that to you for free. The link is here. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye."

04:16 - Outro",AI tools for content creation,6246,813,8,2025-10,"What if your next Tik Tok or real looked like a mini Hollywood film? Sora 2 Pro makes it possible in minutes. This is Higsfield AI and these guys do a lot when it comes to video creation. But what I want to showcase today is Sora 2 because this is honestly one of the best products I've seen in the AI space in a long time. What we can do with this is select Tik Tok, YouTube shorts, Instagram reels, or YouTube. And then we're going to type in our prompt to decide what we want. So for my prompt here, I have put create a feel-good short form video about a guy that finds a wallet on the street and returns it to the owner. Now for this preset, we can actually go ahead and pick anything here from motivational to cinematic if we want. So I quite like dramatic TV teaser here. So that is what we are going to click from that point. We can go to visuals and sound. And yes, if we do look at this, we can select realistic, cartoon, anime, or even custom with our own prompt. Now, all of this will help the clips feel intentional, which is perfect for pacing and motion. So, we can go craziness here. We can go up to medium craziness. We can actually have a montage section here, which will have zero cuts or slow paced or fast-paced. So let's go with slow paced here. And then we can go over to sound and we can select background music where we can custom describe it in a separate prompt or have it as auto. Then for language we can go with any language here. So let's go with English. Speech we can do auto or custom as well. And speech tempo we can have slow, fast or ultra fast. Let's go with slow for this one. Next we save our settings. And then there is another settings tab here in which we can select a little bit more. So we can select the length of the video. We can select the quality whether we want 720p or 1080p. And then we have the mode which will be standard which will have balance speed and quality or pro which will have top fidelity and control. Let's go with pro for this case. Once we're happy with that, we have the option to generate. But if we wanted to have products in this, we could add a product. So, we could put an image or a product would be in the video like we can see above here. And we can also select the unlimited feature here which will basically generate unlimited versions of this video until we're happy with it. But let's go ahead and press generate and wait for the results. And in just a couple minutes, we can see that it's come back with a 12 second Tik Tok. So, let's go ahead and play this and see what it looks like. >> Lost your wallet. Found it on the street. Thought you might want it back. >> You have no idea what this means. >> I think that is brilliant. You can see that the audio is fantastic. The scene logic is really well thought out and the continuity are handled automatically here. So basically everything works together fantastically. Now if we wanted another version of this, what we can do is actually render more and see what it comes back with. And if we like one more, then yes, we can pick that one instead. But personally, I'm pretty happy with this one. It shows the wallet here in this scene. And then obviously the guy is pretty consistent throughout the video. So overall, yeah, I really am super impressed with this product. Definitely go ahead and check it out because when it comes to creators, you can produce viral content with high engagement potential in literally minutes. This is perfect for brands, influencers, and independent creators alike. You can scale your reach easily with high retention videos, all created in minutes with AI. Now, normally, if you were going to create something like this without AI, it could potentially cost you tens of thousands of dollars, and it could take you months to create one video. But this is how far AI has gotten. And honestly, probably the best product on the market right now to do something like this. With each clip feeling intentional with perfect pacing and motion, this is ideal for viral campaigns and social media storytelling. So, create your next viral video with Higsfield Sora 2 Pro with cinematic quality. It's perfectly paced and it's ready for social media in minutes. That's going to be it from me. Check it out in the description. I'll see you in the next"

Watch how fast I turn a blank idea into a presentation that actually feels alive. Let me first show you how long it would take me if I was to create a presentation with PowerPoint. I have PowerPoint open. First, I would need to choose a design. So you choose the design you want. Then you start drag and dropping the boxes. Okay, what should I write as a title? Okay, the software your business needs. And you need to think about the title. Make it interesting. Type your information. Oh, you know what? I don't like the way that it is. Let me move the boxes.

This helps support my channel. Thank you!",AI tools for content creation,8569,209,130,2025-08,"Are you still struggling to find the best AI tools for marketing? Well, you're not alone. There's hundreds of AI marketing tools out there. We have creators pushing tools, fueling their own agendas. So, it's really hard to understand or know what tools are actually good. And in this video, I'm going to be sharing some of my favorite AI tools for marketing and content creation that I've actually used in my business and for clients. So, be sure to stick around for the entire video. And if this happens to be your first time to the channel, welcome. My name is Ryan and I help creators and business owners leverage AI to scale content, save time, and ultimately make more money online. And if you want to know my complete list of favorite AI tools, AI automation templates, prompts, and more, be sure to get my free AI marketing essentials guide. I definitely overd delivered in this free guide. You won't be disappointed. You can find the link for this in the video description or pin comment below. So, when it comes to the best AI tools for marketing, obviously the word best is subjective. And I'm going to be explaining my favorite tools with just a highlevel overview in this video. And if you want to learn more about a particular AI tool, I do have dedicated reviews that you can find in the video description below for each AI tool that I mention. So, first and foremost, I'm just going to be honest with you. If you're still using the free version of Chat GPT, before you go down the rabbit hole and try to test and tinker with all these different AI tools, I would recommend upgrading to the plus version for $20 a month. This is the ultimate Swiss Army knife of AI tools. Yes, there's Claude Pro, there's Grock, there's Gemini Advanced, etc., but most people are still using Chat GPT. The differences between Plus and the free version are actually extremely drastic. I talk about that a lot more in my dedicated review, which I'll leave in the description below. This includes the creation of projects and GPTs. This includes usage limits. This includes the ability to access the most advanced models. GPT40, 03, 04 mini, GPT5 is coming soon, and it might already be here by the time you're watching this video. So, my point being here is that I would recommend upgrading to ChatGpt Plus for $20 a month if you're still using the free version of ChatGpt before I would go down the rabbit hole of any of these other random AI tools. And in terms of practical use cases, there's really a ton that you can do with Chat GPT+. Whether it's content ideiation, whether it's creating content, it's repurposing content from long form to short form. You can do market research now as they have a deep research mode here. They also have agent mode that came out a few weeks ago. That's a pretty revolutionary tool. It's only available to paid users of chat GPT. You can web search. You can generate images using the 40 image generation model and so much more. So if I go to some of my GPTs here for example, and I will and you can find this in my free AI marketing essentials guide. I've left every link to these custom GPTs in there. And you'll notice here I have an email GPT, a viral video GPT. I have some for thumbnails, local SEO service pages, repurposing long form videos for optimized social media posts or Twitter threads. In this particular example, short form video optimizer. I have one dedicated to my email newsletter. Right? So, there's all these different marketing use cases that you can dedicate a custom GPT for. And when it comes to images, the 40 image generation model, like I talked about, is still one of the best AI image models available today. And so you can use this to generate YouTube thumbnails, blog post headers, redesign logos, create logos from scratch, generate ads, generate infographics that you can share on social media or embed within blog posts, etc., etc. And so with that plus version, you get way more access to the 40 image generation model. And on the topic of chat GPT agent, if you're on the plus version, I'd recommend playing around with it just whatever your particular use cases are. But I'll give you a quick real world example of what I use this for related to marketing. I told it to or I asked it to generate me a digital PR report, meaning where have I been featured on the internet? I want an organized spreadsheet with the live link or the URL of that placement, whether that's articles, podcast, uh YouTube videos, TV interviews, radio interviews, etc., etc. So, in about 3 minutes, it literally in the background gen like searched my entire name across the internet, generated this report, found all these placements since 2023. These actually weren't all of them. So, I came back and it gave me a report here. And I basically said, you know, here's some that I actually was on that you didn't have. So, it found 74 unique media placements in addition to providing some of these graphs here that I could go back and maybe ask for even nicer looking graphs. Right? I'm just showing you a very basic use case of what you could do for Chat GPT agent. But as I keep reiterating here, that is one of many reasons why I would recommend starting with ChatGpt Plus for $20 a month versus trying to play around with all of these other white labelled ChatGpt AI marketing tools. So, in addition to ChatGpt Plus, one of my favorite AI tools that I'm using literally every day right now is called Blatado. Now, Blato is an all-in-one AI content pl platform, excuse me. And I particularly use this to automate my entire social media system using my personal brand. You can also create faceless videos. That's a whole other feature that they offer. It starts at only $29 a month. It's owned and operated by one of the fastest growing AI influencers in the world. Her name is Sabrina Romangh. I really respect her. Had her on my channel. I'll leave that video in the description below. And when it comes to that $29 a month price point, this is honestly a steal for what you get in my opinion. You get unlimited AI writing. So think about that for a second. Think about all the AI marketing and content tools out there that cost $29 a month or more. You're extremely capped in the credits that you can use. Whether it's Jasper, Poppy AAI, Copy AI, Right Sonic, Frauds, etc., etc., etc. All of these different AI marketing tools charge either the same or more. and they cap you in credits. So, that right there is huge. Also, the social media APIs. And what do I mean by this? So, I just posted a tutorial, probably one of my favorite tutorials that I've ever posted on my channel about how I've literally automated my entire social media system for my personal brand with the help of Blato paired with Make.com and some other modules like Google Sheets and Google Drive and whatnot. Again, I'd recommend watching that video in the description below. So literally from a Google sheet, I'm using Blatado to help me automate my entire social media content system. And then within the web app, if you don't even want to use the APIs, you can use unlimited content generation from various models, OpenAI's models, Claude Sonnet 4, uh, GPT40, etc., etc. You can also use this for inspiration. They have a ton of different prompts that you can use to help you ideulate and generate content that way. They also have a built-in social media management system. So you can think of it as an alternative to Hootsweet, Sprouto, Buffer that all costs hundreds of dollars a month just for social media. And so what Sabrina Romangh is providing in Blatado AI is actually pretty remarkable in my opinion. And so I hope you can see why this is one of my favorite AI tools for marketing and content right now. And I'd highly recommend checking them out. Now, another AI tool that I use a lot for marketing and content creation is Claude and more specifically Claude Pro. Similar to Chat GPT, the free version of Claude is not very good in my opinion. It's actually more limited than what you get on the free version of Chat GPT. But one of the reasons why I love Claude so much for marketing and content related tasks is the Claude Sonnet 4 model. I've just seen in my outputs of writing emails, social media captions, ad copy, and other content related tasks. I've noticed my outputs are superior with Claude Sonnet 4 versus what I've gotten with like a GPT4 or some of other OpenAI's models. Now, those models aren't bad by any means. I just prefer the outputs of Claude Sonnet 4. It's more humanlike, sounds more realistic in my opinion. And so if I go into my projects, which by the way, that's another feature you can do with Claude Pro. Just like chat GPT, you can build projects inside Claude, whether that's for social media captions, whether that's generating email newsletters, video scripts, taking long form YouTube videos and turning them into SEO optimized blog posts. So, this email newsletter project, for instance, I'm using literally every week to help me generate my newsletter based off of a long form YouTube video that I created from the previous week. You'll notice I actually just used this three hours ago. So, I've trained it on the right with all these different email examples. In the instructions, I've gotten super granular about my writing style, different examples, providing subject lines with the actual open rate percentages. And so when it comes to a task like writing email newsletters, I really love using a claude project for this and more specifically that Claude sonnet 4 model. You can also generate artifacts. So in the world of marketing and content creation, you could spin up a landing page with Claude. You could generate a lead magnet with Claude. Now this is more, you know, Claude in general is more geared towards developers and those who are involved in coding. But don't you know don't disregard the power of Claude Sonnet 4 when it pertains to marketing and copywriting. So that's one of the reasons why I recommend using Claude when it comes to marketing or content creation mostly because of this Claude Sonnet 4 model. And if you want to get a little more technical and maybe do some research, build a landing page, do something more coding related, Claude Opus 4.1 is a very powerful model as well. Now, the next AI tool for marketing and content creation that I'm going to cover in this video isn't just one single tool. I had to batch all of these tools into one. And we'll call them Google's AI tools. Whether that's using Gemini inside the Google Gemini app, so Gemini 2.5 Pro, you can generate images in here and do a lot of similar things that you can do with chat GPT and Claude. But we're not just going to stop there. One of the other things I love about Google's AI tools is Google AI Studio. This is one of the most underrated free AI tools available today. And on the left hand side, you can generate media with this. So whether that's, you know, imagining generating high quality AI images, you can do VO, you can do Gemini speech generation. I believe they have an AI audio generator in here as well. You can build. So you can also use Google AI studio similar to what I just showed you with Claude Artifacts. You can build mini apps inside here and then also you can stream in real time with Gemini Live. And so one thing that I really use this a lot for is if I'm building AI automations like I showed you earlier with Plat. I actually got stuck on this exact automation with several errors. Well, what I would do is pull up Google Gemini or Google AI Studio, come to Gemini Live, click share screen, and then it would literally do a real time screen share of an AI assistant to help me with that marketing automation. Now, think about how you could apply this to anything. Maybe you're stuck inside a Google Ads account. Well, I would pull up Google AI Studio Screen Share, and then it would walk you through it. Maybe you need help with a landing page. Maybe you need help with coming up with content ideas or just something else that's on your screen that you could screen share. This is a very underutilized feature. You can also leverage all of these different AI models inside Google AI Studio here that you cannot access in the normal Gemini app. If I go to Gemini, you know, we get 2.5 Pro, 2.5 2.5 Flash, excuse me. But in here, you get 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, you get 2.5 Flash Light. You can go to Gemini 2.0. 0 Gamma and all these other models inside Google's AI studio. I could talk about this tool forever, but it is criminally underrated. Another free AI tool that's great for marketing and content purposes, of course, is Notebook LM. This is best used for learning and research in my opinion. So, if I pull up one of my recent uh one of my recent notebooks here, of course, you can add all these other sources on the left. I'll leave a relevant video in the description below for Notebook LM. But one thing that's really unique about this in terms of media generation, obviously you can generate the audio overviews, those AI podcasts that we're all familiar with, but they recently came out with video overviews. And so if I click this video overview, I'm not going to play it because it's going to play the audio here, but this creates almost a a professional slideshow or professional slides based on those sources. So obviously you could export this, crop over the notebook LM watermark here on top and kind of rebrand it as something that you would use maybe for a marketing presentation or just some other use cases there. And of course you can leverage Gemini inside the chat box here as well. Another recent AI tool that Google came out with is called Google Opal. This is their free vibe coding tool. I did a full video explaining this and you can use this to build mini apps. So think like a YouTube thumbnail generator. Think about a YouTube trend spotter or any other marketing or content creation related use case that you want to build a mini app for for free. You can leverage Google Opal. Another one obviously is Google Flow. So Google VO has been floating around. That's their AI image generation model. And so inside Google Flow, this is where you can use AI generated videos using V3. I think you get some free plans with this. I haven't fully dove into V3, so don't quote me on that, but I know you must be or you have to be on Google AI Pro to start creating. So, it looks like this isn't available to free users. So, you have to be on that $20 a month plan in order to generate with V3 and start using Flow. But regardless, it's a still a very high quality tool for content creation. And when it comes to other Google Google's other AI tools, I'd recommend looking at Google Labs, labs.google/experiments. I'll leave all of these links in the description below. This is where they're dropping all of their little experiments that they're working on in the background. Notebook LM was in here. Project Mariner is a big one. If I click see more, we have AI mode that's in their search obviously. Career Dreamer, Daily Whis, Whisk, Notebook LM, uh, learn about video FX, image FX, text. I mean, there's just so many different AI tools that they're coming out here with. And so as a marketer or a content creator, there's definitely some relevant options in here that you can explore. So that's my my third quote unquote third AI tool for marketing and content creation is Google's entire stack of AI tools that you can use for these use cases. Now, another high quality AI tool for marketing and market research in particular is Perplexi. It's completely free to get started. Even the free version of Perplexi is a pretty solid product. You can think of this as an alternative to Google search. It's an AI powered search engine. But I will say on the pro version of Perplexity, which I think I get for free at this point with how many referrals that I've given out for this tool, you get access to all of these other AI models using Perplexity search capabilities. And that's big in my opinion. So GPT models like GPT 4.1, Gemini models, Claude models, now Claude Opus 4.1, you have to be a max member of Perplexity. That's $200 a month. But I really like Perplexity for just anything research related. And when it comes to the types of research, if I click here, you can do general web search, you can do academic searches, social, so discussions, forums, and opinions, finance related. And on the topic of spaces, you can actually build customized versions of Perplexity, similar to chat, GPT projects, or claude projects. I think you can do this for free inside Perplexity. And I've made my own AI research assistant. I'll leave my tutorial on how to build this in the video description below. But this is just a really unique feature here. If you're doing something in the field of anything market research or research related in general, I would try Perplexity for free and see what you like. So now getting into a little more advanced AI tools for marketing and content creation, I have to talk about Hey Genen. This is an AI avatar generator that I use to generate my AI clone. It is free to get started, but to actually use I think uh unlimited video generation and some of the other features here, you have to be on that first tier. I think it's $29 a month, somewhere in that range. So, if I click my avatars with Hey GenE, I'm able to create all sorts of different looks from my clone. Wearing different shirt, I'm standing, I'm wearing glasses, I'm not wearing glasses. If you go to my YouTube channel and click shorts, about 90 to 95% of my shorts are powered with my AI clone. So, I use this all the time for short form content creation across my social media platforms. In addition to just creating your clone, you can also do several other things inside Hey Genen, such as creating a video podcast, an interactive video podcast. You can create an interactive avatar. So, if you want to create like an interactive job interview avatar, I think I did that in a previous video on my channel, or some other form of avatar, you can definitely do that as well. And the team at Hey Genen is continuing to add all sorts of new features here. And after testing several AI avatar generators, I do believe that Heyen is the best. I didn't even talk about UGC videos. I believe these are real people where they actually film themselves and they sell their rights to Hey Genen. Don't quote me on that. I think that's what's going on here. So, you don't even have to use yourself or your own AI clone if you don't want. You can use some of these uh AI clones here for UGC content and other forms of content. There's really just so much that you can do with a tool like Hey Genen. I'll leave my tutorials and link to the website in the video description below for more details. I also forgot to mention that hey Genen provides APIs just like I talked about with plat and social media earlier in this video. So, if I really wanted to have a fully automated clone, I could definitely do that. I'll leave that relevant tutorial in the description below if you're interested. Now, the next AI tool actually goes along with Hey Genen. This is called 11Labs. They're a pretty popular AI tool right now. And in my opinion, this is the best AI audio generator available today. They actually just came out yesterday as I'm recording this with a whole music platform called 11 Music. So, you can use this to generate AI audio. Maybe you want to generate a podcast intro or background music for your YouTube video or other form of video that you're creating. But I don't even use 11 Labs for this. I mainly use 11 Labs for my professional voice clone. You have to be on that pro tier. I think it's 20 bucks a month, somewhere in that range where I have my Ryan Dozer AI voice clone that sounds extremely realistic. I pair it with my Hey Genen avatar and that's how I create a really realistic AI clone. So 11 Labs is the other part of that equation and these guys are the best when it comes to high quality professional AI audio. You can also leverage some of these other voices. It doesn't have to be your voice. There's all these other voices that actual people are uploading and getting credits from 11 Labs based on how many times they're being used. So you can use this for, you know, literally everything. Background audio. If you have a faceless YouTube video and you want background audio, you can leverage 11 Labs for that. That's just one of many examples. But when it comes to AI audio, look no further than 11 Labs. So, those were actually my top seven AI tools for marketing and content creation right now, but I wanted to throw in a few others as an honorable mention. One of those being Blaze AI. This actually happens to be one of the most popular videos on my YouTube channel was my review of Blaze AAI. These guys do have a great platform, don't get me wrong. If you're doing anything related to social media or social media management, these guys definitely offer a really appealing user interface. It's a great platform to remix and repurpose long form to short form. They have a really unique brand voice feature in here as well. I'd recommend watching my review of Blaze AI for more information. And the pricing isn't terrible as well. Starts at $34 a month. You don't get as much in terms of features as you do with Blato, but Blaze AI is still a high quality AI tool for content creation. Now, another great AI tool for content creation that I have to mention here is Opus Clip. And while I'm not using Opus Clip anymore, for only $15 a month, this takes long- form videos and literally leverages AI to chop up a long- form video into engaging short form clips that you can repurpose for social media platforms across the board. They have several examples down here of what they mean. And what's really unique about this is the AI technology is actually going through an entire long form video, finding those viral spots based on a virality score that they come up with, optimizing it for vertical format for mobile, adding engaging subtitles, engaging captions, and other features that then you can then post from there within your social platforms, YouTube, Instagram reels, Tik Tok, etc. Now, I have a video editor that, in my opinion, produces higher quality short form videos than what Opus Clip does. But for only $15 a month, if you're doing anything related to video, Opus Clip is a great option. And the last AI tool that I think is worth mentioning here is called SEO writing AI. And if your main use case is writing highquality long- form SEO optimized blog posts, this is a great tool for that. anything short form content content creation related, I would just stick with Chad GPT or Claude and not mess with an AI tool like this. But if you look at their one-click blog post generator, what I really like about this is a how straightforward they make this entire process, but b the quality of the outputs is actually also there as well. They also are very transparent. You can choose between different AI models, clause models, DeepSeek, GPT models, give it a tone, a point of view. You can add a brand voice here. Give it a target keyword. Uh so yeah, you can add your own brand voice. I have a Ryan Dozer brand voice. Add any other details. Mediahub. Uh you can give it structure, internal linking, external linking, connect to the internet. Uh you can publish it straight to your WordPress site. It integrates directly from WordPress. And I think to start it only costs maybe 15, 12, somewhere in that ballpark per month. Now you are capped with credits. That's one of the things I mentioned earlier when talking about Blatado, but they're also frequently updating this tool a lot, too. I've always been impressed with the developers and how often they're updating SEO writing AI. So, again, if your use case is SEO optimized blog post, I would at least give this tool a shot. So, those are my favorite AI tools for marketing and content creation that I'm either using right now or I've used some of those in the past. And if you've made it this far into the video, first and foremost, I appreciate you. If you found value, be sure to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel. I also want to hear your comments below. What are your favorite AI tools for marketing? Are there some AI tools that I should review that I haven't reviewed yet on my channel? Really want to know what you guys have to say on this particular topic. But most importantly, I hope you all have a great day."

04:55 - Outro",AI tools for content creation,6422,760,3,2025-09,"Let me get it right. Your ad costs keep going up, so you switch to an organic method, but then hours scripting, re-shooting, shipping products to creators, waiting weeks for those content, and your sales slow to crawl. But what if I found a solution that can literally do it using AI and B-roll product videos? That's why I'm going to be showing you that all today using this company, ugwizard.com. [Music] Right now, this is ugizard.com. The link will be down in the description for you to do your own due diligence and even follow along with me. Okay. So, what we can see here is you've got make realistic AI UGC videos, product talk, product B-rolls, Reddit stories, and even a hook and demo template. So, what this is basically doing is getting rid of those issues. The bottleneck of the DTC and the ecom creator bottleneck that we all face, let's be honest. Instead of waiting days for videos, you can easily get quality shot product style videos. and talking head creators literally instantly. I'm going to log into the dashboard and show you exactly what I mean as well. But as we go down, we can see the ROI calculator that they have as well. So videos per day, say if you want 10 videos per day, and then average impressions per video, a,000, LTV, click-through rate, conversion rate, you'll have a total sales of $30,000. These are some of the other edits that you can get. Obviously, if you would have seen these on Tik Tok, on YouTube, or any other platform, you would never have guessed that these are AI actors. It's a nice free easy step, but what I'm going to do is log in and show you these free easy steps for your own eyes. Okay, so this is the back office. You can see I'm signed in, subscription, all activated, everything. This is what we've got to offer. You've got talking head videos, UGC, and a product talk plus 5-second product clip, which will be silent, and a rated Reddit story. But what I want to show you first is the product B-roll. Okay, so we're going to upload an image, and we've just got this little camera. Then you can, what you can do is you can go and select an actor from multiple different ones. We're going to go with this lady in the kitchen. And then we're going to say, ""Hold up the camera as if she was taking a photo."" And then we're going to generate that image preview. Like it says there, please don't leave this page. May take 10 to 60 seconds. Obviously, you can use this for other product images as well, whether it's a water bottle. We can do anything. Take a photo of it, upload, and then this is what it will show you. Two different options. And then you have the option to generate a video with a script of your choice as well. And there we have it. Nice and fast. Look at some of these images that they have given us. They've got the camera in the screen. They've got it picturing up. This is also one that's probably very similar to what we were talking about. Right now, once your image has been produced and you pick on either option A or option B, you need to put in a grip for the actor to talk about. Okay. So, what we're going to be doing is the camera by far the best on the market with excellent shutter speeds and fast response times. Now, you do have to do a minimum of 100 characters for this to work, but as you can see this button here, we just press preview. Now, once we've done the preview, it's going to generate the audio preview for us to look back on and just make sure. >> By far the best on the market with excellent shutter speeds and fast response times. >> And as you can see, that sounds so realistic. So then, as you go down, all you have to do is click on generate video. And then, as you see up here, Product Talk job cued, we'll email you when it's ready or go back home to track your status. the message would disappear in 10 seconds or swipe leaf to dismiss. So, this would be ideal for ads, PDP videos, and also social content without a camera. Right now, once you're back at the home page, you could scroll down and you can see that it's comedy processing, the actor was Alice, model is the base, and the camera is by far the best. So, once this comes back, I'll be showing you exactly what that looks like on the screen for you to check as well. Right now, one of the good things about this, while this loads, I just want to talk to you about the AB testing. Okay. So, what that means is that you can paste multiple different hooks into this video and then send it out into a process of elimination for example. So, you can create five, six, seven, eight different hooks and then you can work out which one is actually performing better. Now, why is this important? Because it limits the delays of traditional production. Not only that, but it generates tons of versions all at once. So, it's not a case of going back to the creator and asking them to do a different hook. You can put everything into this wizard and that is exactly it. You can create as many as you want. And there we have it, guys. Now, honestly, that literally took maybe two to three minutes to create, but we're going to click on it and take a look in exactly how this looks. >> The camera is by far the best on the market with excellent shutter speeds and fast response times. >> As you can see, that is looking perfect. You can see that it looks so natural. Going to change the way we create videos. Now, if that's something that you are looking to be interested in, clicking that link in the description for you to do your own due diligence, sign up, and create those reels that normally take 3 to five working days if it's a good creator. But thank you very much for watching. If you like this video, hit that like button, hit the subscribe button, press that bell to be notified of my next video. Bye for now. base."

06:04 - Outro",AI tools for content creation,6875,708,9,2025-10,"You know that feeling when you watch a movie scene and think, ""I could have directed that better."" Now you actually can without cameras, actors, or a crew. I'm not a professional adviser, but let's get it on. All right, guys. So, this is the landing page of Higsfield. The link to this will be in the description of the video. So, Sara 2 Pro by Higsfield marks a monumental leap in the artificial intelligence film making. Now in action it showcases the creation of a complete multi-secene short film and each transition is smooth, natural and emotionally consistent. So every frame flows logically into the next which proves that the system understands not just the visuals but the narrative rhythm of the entire video. Now lip sync and the voice timing are perfectly aligned with the audio cues and that is actually what makes an awesome artificial intelligence content. Now while the emotional continuity is actually maintained across every scene. Now with the unlimited generations features the creators can actually experiment endlessly refining their stories without any constraint. No, more than just an upgrade, guys. Sora 2 Pro is a full cinematic brain. It employs that advanced narrative reasoning to preserve the tone, the pacing, and the story arcs. Now, essentially, that is going to turn the scripts into living films. Okay. Directing with the Sora 2 Pro also feels like directing or writing a movie in text and then instantly watching it unfold in crisp 1080p realism. All right, so I am actually logged in right now and then you could actually head on to Sora 2 Pro by going to video right here and then clicking on Sora 2. Now once you have already put in the necessary information and even the image that you are going to be using for that video and in case I'm using like a watch here. Okay, it's going to be a random smart watch that I would put in and then I clicked on or put in the prompt right here. So create a promotional video showing the Halo Solar Ultra smart watch including the sports where the person is wearing okay watching golf. And then for this one guys, that is actually the one I did for the previous one. Now I want to show you another thing that I created. So for this guys, I actually created another ad or a prompt. This is actually like a solo mining um Bitcoin miner or something like that. So this is the NerdQX++. Okay, so this is like a still image of that one. And then I created a prompt. So create a promotional video showing the Ner QX++ show the background of a volcanic lava and crypto mining. Okay. And then the model of course the Sora 2 Pro. And then for the duration you can select either 4, 8 seconds or 12 seconds. So it's like like a B-roll that you could use. Okay. In my case I used 12 seconds. And of course if you choose a shorter one the amount of credits that will be used will also be smaller. Okay. And that goes along with the resolution. So you have 720p and you have 1080p. And you also have the option to select what aspect ratio you would like. Okay. So it's 16x9 for landscape. So like for long form videos and whatnot. And then 9x6 for you have reals like Instagram reels, Tik Tok videos. You also have YouTube shorts. 9x6. Okay, that's the one that you're going to be using. Now once you are done with that, you just click on generate. And it's normally going to take you like 10 to 15 minutes. So relax. I mean, once you click on it, it will show you that it's in queue or if it's already doing it or something like that. And it's normal for it to take like 10 to 15 minutes to generate a video. And let me show you how it looks like for this one. So this is the one that I did creating a promotional video showing the nerd background of volcanic lava. Sizzing Nerd Hacks Plus+ engineered to thrive where the heat is real. Harness the power of a nextgen Shaw mining core with snats on a crystal blaze displaying up to 40% less power draw than other compact miners. >> I mean, look at that. You created that in just like 10 to 15 minutes. Oh my gosh. I mean, if I'm going to be manually editing that, it's going to take me hours or even days. All right, guys. I would strongly suggest, of course, that you do your own research. Head on over to their website. There's a ton of information that will help you out in getting to know them better. You have visual effects, you have Higsfield, Soul, you have Vigfield apps and all that once you hover over image, you have all types of artificial intelligence there in the Sor 2. So guys, perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of Sora 2 is its accessibility and there is no region locker of some sort. No usage cap and basically no gatekeeping. So anyone anywhere in the world can actually now harness the artificial intelligence to direct compelling storyrich film making. Now with that Sora 2 Pro, Higsfield brings global unlimited and intelligent film making into the hands of creators ready to tell the stories that truly move. So head to Higsfield right now guys. Unlock Sora 2 Pro. Script your story and direct your own film today without the need of a single piece of gear or the equipment. Those expensive equipment. Oh my goodness. And if you are new to the channel, hopefully you would consider clicking that like that subscribe and click that bell. That way you always be notified when I upload new videos like this in the future. I'll see you on the next. I'm out. Peace."

#ai  #chatgpt  #youtubeautomation  #facelessyoutubechannel",AI tools for content creation,68204,3381,77,2025-10,"The video where I showed how to make AI horror shorts went crazy. And honestly, the response told me one thing. [music] You guys don't just want short stories, but also cinematic long- form horror videos, too. So, I decided to take it a step further. This time, we're creating full AI horror animations that look studio level, but still only take a few hours, [music] not weeks. Horror animations. specifically channels like Horror Shorts Party, almost 1 and a.5 million subs, [music] 1.2 million views in the past 7 days, and pulling anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 [music] plus monthly. And here's the part that made me actually dive into this myself. You don't need to be an animator. You don't need years of experience. You [music] don't even need fancy software. I spent the last two weeks reverse engineering these channels, [music] testing every AI tool they're using, building the system from scratch to see if it actually works. It does. So, in this video, I'm walking you through the exact process I use to create horror animations that look like they came from a professional studio. Look, I've been building faceless channels for years now. Some worked, most didn't at first, but horror animation, this is different because combining storytelling with animation has always had an audience. Always. This isn't some trend that's going to die in 3 months. People have been consuming [music] horror content for decades. And right now, the barrier to entry is lower than it's ever been because of AI tools. I used to believe this whole YouTube thing was impossible until I started working behind some of the biggest [music] faces on the platform. That's when it clicked. These people were making real money, and none of it was rocket science. I took what I learned, built my own channels, tracked every metric, and figured out what actually works [music] and what doesn't. What I'm showing you today is the same system I've used to build channels that consistently pull millions of views. Before we jump in, this is a snippet of what the final animation looks like. Full cinematic horror story, AI generated, professional quality. And at the end of this video, you'll watch the complete version. so you can see exactly [music] what this system produces. All right, let's begin. First step, you need story ideas people actually want to watch. Horror content spans a wide range, but our goal is finding angles that haven't been explored to death yet. So, here's what I do. I've built out a prompt [music] system specifically for generating unique horror story ideas. Prompt doc is in the description. Open it. Copy the instructions from the title prompt section. Then, go to chat GPT or whatever AI you prefer. Paste the prompt, hit enter. You can specify which genre you prefer or just keep it broad and insert horror stories like I did. Instantly, you'll get 10 story ideas. You can fully customize these prompts to fit your style. The key is volume. Generate enough ideas that you can pick the best ones and [music] build a content calendar around them. Now, pick one idea and move to the next step. Before we move to scripting, next step is finding out which thumbnail concept you'll be using. Look at your competitor's most recent videos. Find which title and idea is similar to yours that's doing well. Grab their thumbnail. Save it. We'll be using it later. Make sure you stay until the end. We'll finalize our thumbnail, and it's by far our most important step in this process. Now, let's move to the script. Retention lives or dies on your script. It's what makes 1K view [music] videos turn into 500K ones. When people click on a horror video, they're expecting mystery, suspense, real fear. You need to deliver that through your storytelling. So, go back to the doc file, copy the script prompt section, paste it into chatpt. Then, above [music] your prompt, paste the title and idea you're using for your video. For example, I picked idea number six, pasted it in, hit enter. Chat GPT will ask which tone you want to mimic from your competitors. I picked option A, the creepy pasta structure. [music] It immediately generated my horror story script based on their style. For this example, I kept it at just one short horror story around 60 seconds playback, but your script will be much longer. At the end, it asks if you need more or the rest of your stories. [music] Just request it. Chat GPT will create additional stories effortlessly. Now, here's my recommendation. Read through the generated stories yourself. Add your own creative touches. Make the narrative more unique [music] because the difference between good and great is in those small details AI can't think of. That's how you build something that feels human and not robotic. We'll set the script aside for a second so we can generate our images. [music] Now, we're at the stage where everything starts coming together visually. First, we create the images. Then, we turn them into animations that will captivate the audience. For this niche, we're making 2D [music] images and animations. So, the first thing we need are the images to represent our scenes. Go back to the doc [music] file. Copy the image prompt section. Paste them into Chat GPT where you produced your script. Chat GPT starts generating character descriptions and visual prompts for your story. As you can see, it creates 20 prompts for [music] images and characters. If you need more, just request additional prompts and it'll generate new ones. Good rule of thumb, every 60 seconds, you'll need around 10 to 15 images. Now, to create the actual images, go to Google and search [music] for image FX. Click image FX and select enter the tool. Go back and copy the first prompt, then paste it. Select YouTube size, click generate. Within seconds, [music] your images are ready. Then go back to the doc or wherever your generated image prompts [music] are. Copy the next prompt, paste it into Whisk, and generate the next set of images. The prompts are carefully detailed so the images come out [music] with high quality. Repeat this process until you have images for all of your scenes. Now that our images are ready, it's time to turn them into animations. Go to the doc file, copy the prompt section, paste it into Chat GPT. ChachiPT creates highquality video props so well prepared you don't even need to worry about sound effects or [music] additional visual effects. Next, go back to Whisk. Select the image you want. Click animate. Paste the video prompt that was generated for that specific scene and hit generate. After around 30 seconds, boom, first animation [music] sequence is ready. Looks highly professional and polished. For the second sequence, repeat the same process. [music] Select the best image. Copy the prompt. Paste it. Generate. Continue this process for all sequences until every scene has been transformed into animation. Now, you don't have to add animations to every single one of your images. I left some unanimated since we'll be adding movement to the images in the editing [music] process. So, while the rest of our video animations are being produced, let's [music] work on the voice. I'll be using 11 Labs for this. Click text to speech, then select voice. Personally, I recommend Callum for the voice. It carries the right tone and [music] atmosphere for this niche. Then go back to your doc or wherever you placed your script. Copy the script. Paste it into 11 Labs. Format the script cleanly and click generate. [music] Within moments, your voice over is ready. Download it. Now, let's go back to Whisk. All of our videos and images should be done. Download all of the images and videos you want included in your final video. All right, [music] our video production is almost complete. Now it's time for final editing. I used the desktop version of [music] Cap Cut for this. Click create project. Import all the video sequences we created along with the voice over. First add the voice over to the timeline. Callum talks slowly. So [music] what I did is up the speed of the audio to 1.1 times. If there are any long pauses, [music] remove them, but be careful not to mess up the main audio. Once the pauses are removed, [music] place all the videos and images on the timeline and synchronize them with the voice over. Continue this carefully until every sequence matches the [music] narration perfectly. Now, let's add key frames to all of our sequences. This is very simple. Just click on the visual, go [music] to aspect ratio, and there should be a diamond shape. Adjust the ratio to 104. Press the diamond and do it again on the right side of the visual and adjust the ratio to around 120. >> [music] >> Then rightclick the key frame and add ease in or ease out. Then do the same for the rest of the visuals. [music] Now it's time for transitions. I use the fade in and fade out transition to create smooth, natural movements between [music] sequences. Apply this transition consistently throughout the video. Preview the video, analyze, and see if there is anything to fix. Once everything is ready, [music] head over to the top right and export the video. We're almost done with the entire process. All that's left is finalizing our packaging, [music] specifically our thumbnail. We should have our competitor's thumbnail that [music] we saved. All you want to do is visually break down what the thumbnail looks like. [music] Or instead, you can do what I did. I'm using this GPT model I created for my members. This GPT breaks thumbnails down into [music] literal data. This is what I used to reverse engineer virality. It decodes color [music] psychology, layout, text placement, everything into a brick of JSON. Then [music] all that's left is pasting it back into Chat GPT where you created your script and Chat GPT will personalize the JSON to match your title and video concept. Now just take that newly personalized JSO and paste it under the best styled [music] image that Wisk created for you. And boom, in just 5 minutes, if that, we literally created a proven thumbnail. Members inside Creator OS get full access to this GPT model, plus all the [music] other workflow resources. First link in the description if you want it. And look, I get it. This probably seems like a lot of steps [music] in creating a video that may or may not get more than 100 views. But here's the thing. Your first video might take you four hours, maybe five, but the second one takes three hours. The third one, two hours. By video 10, you've built a system that runs on [music] almost zero effort. Everything will be pretty much second nature. Because the key to success on YouTube isn't one viral video. It's consistency, showing up. So, if you're serious about growth and [music] building something that lasts, that's exactly what we focus on inside Creator OS. people exactly like you who are actually creating channels, testing [music] systems, and sharing what works. First link in the description or pinned comment [music] if that sounds like where you need to be. If not, no worries. Also, the video isn't over yet. [music] The animation we created is about to play, so stick around and let me know what you think in the comments. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next"

And the truth is, this is the secret for how all the top creators and brands are generating so much more traction than everyone else. They've all built winning content systems using a specific combination of AI tools. Now, I'll be honest, most AI tools are absolute trash, and the ones that aren't are usually way too general to actually help you with content unless you really know what you're doing. But here's the good news. I built a workflow that uses AI tools to speed up the content creation process significantly. It's some AI and some human. And this isn't faceless AI slop content. These are the actual videos that I post that get tens of millions of views every single month. So, in this video, I'm going to break down my entire AI content system. This is my five-step workflow that uses AI tools to generate highquality videos way faster than normal. And by the way, if you don't know me, my name is Callaway. I have a million followers. I've done billions of views. and I'm one of the biggest creators in both the AI and content marketing spaces. So, this intersection AI and content is all I do all day long. All right, the first step, we'll call it step zero, is to define the content workflow. And it's really very simple. You've got idea, research, scripting, recording, and editing. This is the same five-step workflow that everybody has to go through to make any piece of video content. Now, the secret for winning on social media is to build a system that lets you get through that five-step workflow as quickly as possible while still coming up with unique ideas, novel angles, winning hooks, viral scripts, and editing that actually holds attention. You can't just build an AI workflow that pumps out bad AI content, or you won't get the results you want. So, you need tools that will speed up the process while also maintaining the level of quality that will cut through. And that's the system we're going to break down right now. Okay. Step number one in the workflow is the idea. Most people have absolutely no process for generating and filtering ideas. And this first step really is where the content game is won and lost. Now, there are three places you can look to generate winning content ideas. The first is to just generate them from your own imagination. We'll call these originals. The second is to look at other content platforms outside of your home base. So, if you're focused on Instagram, you might look at email newsletters, X, YouTube, podcasts, linear TV, blogs, really anywhere that people are talking about your topic outside of your home platform. And the third option for finding ideas is to look at other creators in your niche on the home platform that you're focused on. So, if you're primarily focused on Instagram, this would be looking at other creators in your niche specifically that make short form video on Instagram. Now the traditional process for generating ideas, the nonsismatized approach is what I call just in time ideiation. This is what most people do and why creating content takes so long for them. Every time you want to make a video, which is usually every day, you sit down and start scrolling the feed to find new video ideas. Now, this process can take 5 minutes or a couple of hours. And people are doing this every single day. This is where you're losing a bunch of time and efficiency. And that's because when you scroll the feed for ideas, you're getting maximum noise and minimum signal. Even though the algorithms are serving you some good videos in your niche, you still have to wade through a bunch of unrelated nonsense. This is all noise. It's a complete distraction from your productivity. And what happens, as we all know, is that every time you open the feed to scroll for ideas, you end up getting sucked into something unproductive or you feel bad about yourself for the progress that other people in your space are making. I know this is what happens because I did the exact same thing for a very long time. It takes forever to make content when you're searching for new ideas every single day by scrolling. So, here's the systematized approach for coming up with ideas that will reduce your ideation time down to 1 hour per week. You can spend more time if you want, but you're not going to have to if you want to go as fast as possible. All right. First, you have to understand that the highest signal source for ideas is option three that I mentioned before. Option three was looking at other creators in your niche on your home platform. specifically looking at the videos they've made that have outperformed everything else that they've posted. We call these outliers, and this really is the cheat code for ideiation. Your goal is to find the outliers that outperformed everything else and study why they outperformed. If you can reverse engineer those pieces, you can easily make your own and you'll grow a lot faster. So, here's what I literally do when it comes to ideation. This is my actual process. I do this whole thing on sandcastle.ai. This was my content super tool built specifically for this workflow. The first thing I do is make a watch list of all the creators on my home platform in my niche that are crushing with short form content. So for me in this example that I'm showing you, it's on Instagram for tech and AI. That's the niche we're covering. Now this can be other creators, it can be brands, it can be faceless channels. It doesn't matter who it's coming from, but you need channels that are doing well, high views, and growing fast. Now, to find them and add them to my list on Sand Castles, all I have to do is search their username or their URL in the channels tab in the search bar. When they come up, I click them and I add them to my list. It could not be easier. So, I've already done this for Tekken AI content. I've got these 18 to 20 creators. These are all the best in the world for my niche and I just added them one by one following the process I just went through. Now, on the channels tab in Sandcastles, you can already see in the upper left there are over 20,000 of the top accounts across Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube already loaded into Sand Castles. You can search those names, click the card, and they're available right now. But Sand Castles is not just limited to those 20,000 channels because you can literally add anyone else you want just by searching and importing. All you have to do for anyone on Instagram, Tik Tok, or YouTube is just paste in their username or paste in their URL. If they don't come up, click add to channel or that add to channel button on the right side and then import them. Sand castles will automatically index their entire backlog and that person will be included in the network forever moving forward. So seeing this, you have unlimited flexibility to build any list with any amount of people across Instagram, Tik Tok, or YouTube, whether they're already on sand castles today or not. And I'm telling you, building these watch lists in Sand Castles is the single greatest time-saving content productivity hack you could do. And I'm going to show you why it's so helpful when it comes to ideation and the rest of the workflow right now. All right. Once I have that watch list built, and it's really just a onetime effort, I then go to the videos tab in Sandcastles. On the videos tab, I can filter by the watch list I just made. And this shows me all the videos posted by just those accounts in my watch list. So what I do after I filter by the watch list is I go to post date and I restrict the posts to the last 30 or 60 days. I also go to engagement rate and I set the minimum to.5%. So I can filter out all the paid brand deals. And what is left are the top performing organic videos from just the accounts in my watch list over the last month or two. This is the cream of the crop for your niche. These are the only videos you need to study if you want to replicate the winners. Now, if you want to surface the top videos from smaller channels in your niche, any of the channels with fewer followers that are growing faster, you just want to sort this list by outlier score. That tends to favor the smaller channels. On the flip side, if you want to see the best videos at the top from the biggest channels, I call these the proven winners or the thoroughbred horses, you can sort by views instead of outlier score. This tends to favor the bigger existing channels over the smaller. If you want the most recent post by the last 30 days, you don't really care. They're organized by performance. You just want to see the ones that have posted immediately. Go change the sort to posted date. So, you pretty much have three ways to sort the videos. They're all going to be the same, last 30 or 60 days from your watch list, not including brand deals, but you can kind of order the list to favor small, big, or recent, depending on what you like. Now, all you have to do from here to get a collection of winning ideas that have already been validated in your niche is just watch the videos one by one. You could watch 10, 50, 100, however many in a batch that you want to do at one time. Typically, I like to do maybe 25 to 50 at a given time. Now, this right here, what you're looking at is pure signal, no noise for the tech and AI niche that I've curated over the last couple months because every single video you watch here will be a validated winner in your niche. You don't have to look at anything unrelated, anything weak or poor performing. It's all right here. Cream of the crop. Now, as I'm watching the individual videos, what I then do is I extract out seven core variables from each video. And I just write a couple words for each of these. The seven core variables are the following. Topic, which is just a oneliner describing the video. Angle, which is a short summary framing the meat or facts or takes, really like what makes up the video. So if topic is a oneliner, the angle or couple sentences describing the thing that was covered in the video. Three is the hook format and that's made up of the spoken hook, what is actually said, as well as any notes on the visual hook that is shown. Four is the story format or style. This is the way the story flows and how it's written. Five is the visual format. So that's the layout of the visuals. Is it green screen, split screen, full screen? Like how are the visuals actually laid out? Six is the visuals themselves. Are there specific visuals that really catch your eye? Maybe it's a 3D render or some AI generated thing or some AI B-roll where the background is really cool. And then seven is audio, the music, the sound effects, really like the whole audio vibe of the piece. And I'm just jotting down a couple of words here and there. If I have a format that I know the frame for, I'll write it down. If I don't, I'll just describe it. Now, what this allows me to do is that I can map the components that make up the winning video. Because when you don't know what you're doing, when you watch a video, it's hard to know why you liked it or why it was interesting. If you break it into these seven components, you can start to understand what went into making up the video that was interesting or good. What this does is it starts to build a supererset of options for each variable. So, for example, let's say I watched 25 videos about Tekken AI and these were the best 25 from the last 2 months ranked by views. I went one by one by one. Now, as I zoomed out at my paper and I see the seven variables for each of the 25, I can start to recognize, oh, for visual formats, there are only five different visual formats that show up across the best videos. And those were green screen, faceless, split screen, full screen, a-roll, and yap, for example. There's about 40 different types of visual formats. We'll have a doc on sand castles breaking those down, but let's just say those five were what I saw over and over. This then becomes my possible set of formats that I can choose from when I make my own videos. So, if I'm lost trying to figure out what videos will work in tech, I now see those five visual formats work over and over. I should pick one of those to start with on my own version. And this is super important. The best way to figure out how to make your videos work is to find an existing video that worked. Look at the seven variables and try to figure out which variables to keep the same and which variables to change in your own way. This is kind of like the scientific method approach for content and it makes it so much easier for beginners when you simplify it in these terms. And so when I go to make a video, I look at the top of my list and I see this first topic that I've extracted and I say, ""Okay, if I'm going to make my version, maybe I keep the topic and the angle and the hook the exact same as the reference, but I completely change the way the story is told, the visual format that I lay the visuals out, and the actual visuals that I'm using. So I keep some the same and I make some different, and now I've got a new version. Or maybe I do the flip. I keep the hook and the story and the visuals and the audio the same, but I pick a new topic with a new angle. And so now I've got their format and execution, but my own topic and angle. See, it's a new combination. This idea phase, this research process is all about figuring out which variables worked in your niche, getting that superset clear, and then knowing which Lego options you have to build your own stack. Now, if you want, I will make another video much slower where I'm literally clicking through sand castles and doing this process idea by idea by idea and walking through how I'm deciding which to remix. I can make that for another video. That'll be a full long tutorial, so I can't include it here. If you want that, just comment something like, ""Give me the idea sauce chef"" with a little chef emoji with the chef hat. Just put that in the comments and I'll know exactly what to do. Now, I'm telling you, if you spend just a single hour per week running this validated idea mining exercise that I just walked through, you walk away with dozens of topics, angles, hooks, and formats that are proven to work in your niche. And then you can pick and choose how you stack them up to build your own signature style. So, step one in the workflow, remember we're going through the five-step workflow. We're still in ideas. Step one is to just run this process once per week. Now, if you want to fully systematize this and get yourself completely out of it like I did, you can hire someone to run the process that I just went through. You could send them this video, train them up on it, and then they do the idea mining process for you. The beauty of Sand Castles is that the person you hire doesn't need access to your Instagram to see your algorithm scrolling history. They can just jump on Sandcastles and build the watch list the exact same way you do. So, it'll either take you 1 hour per week or someone else you hire 1 hour per week. But we've just reduced your ideation time down from 5 to 10 hours of scrolling per week down to one. Now, I mentioned before those two other paths for coming up with ideas. One of them was brainstorming originals and the other was looking at other content mediums outside of your home base. For the originals, when you do come up with an original idea that you didn't see anywhere else, just jot that down on a note and just capture it as they come. Most people are not going to be able to come up with a bunch of original ideas every single day. And so, you don't want to build a system that relies on that raw innovation every single time. When you do come up with an original, what makes it challenging is that you're going to have to figure out what all of those seven variables are. When you find an outlier, you can decide to hold some the same and just change a few. But with an original, you got to build the full stack on your own without having that validation. That's why original ideas are so much harder to make. For the other content platforms outside of your home base, if you want to systematize this as well, you could schedule intentional scroll time for 20 to 30 minutes per week, or you could use a product like ChatGBT Pulse. I also like Feedley, which is kind of like an aggregator of different blogs and newsletters. So, you could structure those kind of aggregation systems to minimize the amount of time you're scrolling on all of those surfaces. But just to frame this, here's how I think about ideiation. The goal is to make your ideation process like Grey Goose vodka. You want it to be four times distilled. The raw social feeds like YouTube or X, those are completely unfiltered. You're getting some algorithmic direction, but you're also getting a bunch of random stuff. So, that's like the base, least filtered way. Email newsletters give you one layer of filtering because the people writing the newsletters are trying to look at the social feeds and pick out the best stories. So that helps a little bit. Now content creators in your niche are going to be a second layer of filtering cuz they're reading the email newsletters and other aggregation sources and they're only making videos on the best of the best. Right? So that's two layers of filtering. Sand castles with your watch list is providing a third layer of filtering because now you're not looking at all content creators. You're looking at only content creators that you've hand selected in your watch list. Then when you filter the videos feed in Sandcastles, that's a fourth layer of filtering because now you're not just looking at the videos from the creators you've chosen. You're only looking at the best videos from the creators you've chosen. So when you come across an idea in Sandcastles that's at the top of the video's feed in the process we just went through. That's four times distilled. And that is how you minimize noise and maximize signal in the ideation process. All right. So at the end of step one, you should have a Google doc that has all of your shortlisted ideas. And for each of those ideas, you've broken down in seven bullets the core seven elements or components that you've extracted. You don't have to go crazy just jotting down a few words or phrases here and there so that you know what the elements were so you can zoom out and see the patterns. Now, when it comes time to make your next video, you're going to pick the best idea on the top of that list. If you have anything time-sensitive, you can prioritize that. But if you don't, you just pick the one that you're most excited about. But as I've already mentioned, you're not just going to straight copy the topic, the script, the hook, the angle word for word, because that would be corny and unoriginal. So this is where step two comes in, which is the research. Now, the goal with the research step is to try to find some unique take or interesting angle that can help make your version of the idea a little bit more unique to you. Typically, what makes someone's video original when they're holding the topic constant is by changing the angle, the actual meat or facts or take in the video. Now, the traditional non-sistatized way to approach research is then spending another 30 to 60 minutes deep diving and learning everything you can about the topic so you can try to build your own take. Again, that is a lot of time. Some people are already 2 hours in the holster on this idea and they haven't even started scripting yet. But here is the systematized based approach that I used for research to get through this piece a lot faster. In step one, when I was doing the idea and I was writing down those seven pieces, I'm watching the video for 60 seconds one time through. Now, the goal, as we talked about, is when you're watching the video, you're trying to extract those original components. But now that I'm in the research phase, I'm going to go back to that idea and I'm going to ask myself three questions, trying to find a new angle that the original creator has missed. The first question is, what did I find interesting about the original video that I wish the creator talked about more? The second question would be, what unanswered questions do I have after watching the original video? And the third question I ask myself is, what unanswered questions would a beginner have after watching that original video? Now, my goal is to find some additional information, something the creator missed that I can use to frame the idea in a different way. Sometimes, if you're making content on a topic you already have a lot of knowledge about, you don't actually need to go do additional research, right? Cuz just asking those three questions might pop an insight or a fact, something you pull from your own experience, and that becomes your new angle. Boom, research done. But if you don't have experience or original context on the topic, then you're going to have to kick into this research phase to try to find a new perspective. Now, for me, what happens when I'm in this mode? I just don't have the knowledge or perspective on the topic. I'm going to go to Chat GBT andor YouTube to try to close this research gap as quickly as possible. First, I start with Chat GBT. And when I get there, I use this prompt every single time. I want to make a video about X topic. Can you build a report summarizing what is going on, breaking down the most interesting aspects that will induce max shock, and sharing a super contrarian take on the implication? Assume I know nothing about the topic, but I want to know 99% after reading your report. All I've watched so far is this video, and then I'll put the link to the original reference in there. Now, this is really important. The goal here is not to do deep research and spend 20 minutes learning every nook and cranny about this topic. That is procrastination. All you need is a short cliffnotee summary to try to find an interesting piece that the original creator missed that you can frame your video around. Typically, you can close the gap on this in just 2 to 3 minutes with ChatGBT. Again, if you want to systematize this even further, you can build a chat GPT project that acts like a template where you paste those instructions in as a system instructions and then all you have to do is write in the topic, paste the link, and it will generate the report right away. Now, sometimes if chat GPT isn't enough or it's just like a really complex thing where I need a visual to explain, I will go to YouTube to try to close this gap on the research, but I know that if I go to YouTube, the search is not very optimized. I'm going to end up in a rabbit hole and I'm going to waste a bunch of time. So, I try not to do that unless I really have to. Now, all you're really looking for at this research stage are one to two non-obvious interesting facts and maybe one contrarian take that the original post didn't have. If you have a unique perspective on what the story means, write it down. If you have a unique take or angle, write that down. Typically, shocking and non-obvious truths that you find that you haven't heard before is usually all you need to make the angle compelling. Now, at this point, you should have spent five, maybe 10 minutes, and you'll have three to five sentences written down next to the angle. Right? You've got those seven bullets. Next to angle, you've got three to five sentences featuring a breakdown of the facts or takes that you found that you think are most interesting. Now, the AI and the script writing step will take care of the rest, and I'm going to go through that in a second. So, you really don't need to polish it much beyond this. Again, you can go longer on this research step if you want to, but you're not going to have to once you see the rest of the workflow, and it's all about deciding where to spend your time. Now, for me, I have somebody on my team that does everything we've walked through so far for me. He runs through sand castles a couple times a week. He distills the best ideas. He goes through this research flow in chatbt and YouTube to close the gap. And then we have a call where he pitches me the ideas one by one and asks me if we should make them or not. This is what true content systemization looks like. So if you've been following along, I've reduced my personal time involvement in this flow to zero. The ideas and the research, I don't do them. I have someone else doing that for me following the process I just walked through. For the guy on my team that does this, I call this role a content operator. This person would handle all of the front-end ideation, the research, and then ultimately pitch it to you, frame it, package it up, so you can decide which ideas to make. Now, if you don't have somebody on your team that can do this, or you don't have the resources for it yet, that's totally fine. You don't need to have a content operator. But this is what full systematization would look like. And that's why I broke down this whole process step by step so that you could do it for yourself if you don't have a content operator. So, so far, the ideation should have taken you 1 hour per week, and you can do that in a batch. And then the research should take three to five minutes, maybe 10 max per video if you're really dialing it in with chatbt. Okay, now we're moving into step three in the workflow. And this is the script writing. Coming to this step, you should have your idea short list. And each idea, you should have those seven bullets. And for the angle, you should have the three to five sentences that you wrote down from the research. Specifically, what's most interesting or non-obvious to you about the topic that you want to include? And this can be bullets or sentences. Just write it clearly in a kind of logical way. It doesn't have to be in a certain format. Now, here's where I lean on AI a lot for this workflow, but I also have a human review in the loop at the end. I've spent a long time trying to build a script writing flow with AI. If you follow this channel, you know I have some of the deepest stuff on script writing when it comes to short form and long form content. I'm so deep on this and I've spent so many hours trying to build this fully automated AI workflow. But the truth is what I found is that even the most dialed chatbt or clawed project just doesn't quite get there with respect to the consistency that I want. And if it does nail the flow and the format, it doesn't sound like me. And so there's always manual intervention required. But I will say the latest version of scripting we have in Sandcastles is the best AI generated scripting that I've ever seen. It's the best in the world. And the reason Sandcastles works so well, better than Chad GBT and Claude, even though it's built on top of those, is that it doesn't try to oneshot the script. And this is a really critical thing that we figured out. There's a feature in Sand Castles called the Vault, which approaches content script writing in a different way than any other platform in the world. We kind of pioneered this. The Vault allows you to save components of outlier videos. Those components that we extracted in step one with the ideas. And these components then become templates that you can use when you're writing new scripts. As of this recording, the first two components you can actually save as templates in the vault are hooks and styles. Now, hooks are obviously hooks. is the first few lines spoken in the video. Styles are a combination of the writing style. So, the rhythm, the tone, the pacing, the flow, like the way it's written, as well as the storytelling structure, the actual story flow from section 1, 2, 3, and how the points go together. We combine those two things, the style and flow into one thing called the style. And so, the full workflow for how you do this ideation and use the vault is the following. You find an idea in the videos tab. You start extracting out those seven variables. Again, as a reminder, topic, angle, hook, style, visual format, visuals, and audio. Those are the seven variables. Two of those, hook and style, can be saved into Sandcastles automatically. And so, what you do is if you come across a video and you really like the way it's hooked, you get hooked, or you like the flow and structure of the story. All you have to do is click on that video, get to the idea detail page, click that button that says save to vault, and then you can save the hook andor style. All you have to do is name it. And for the hook, you specify the amount of lines in the transcript that you want to grab as the hook. Now, what happens next is pretty magical. When you go to the vault tab, you can see that hook and style that you just saved. Now, the hook, as you can see on the right, shows up at the bottom as the original word for word hook from the transcript, but we've also automatically translated it into a Mad Lib format. That's what you see on the top. We've substituted all of the core words, nouns, emotions, verbs, adjectives into variables that turn this into a template that can be used for other videos. If for whatever reason the transcript grab or the Mad Lib translation wasn't perfect, you just hit the pencil icon and you can edit it super quickly. This becomes a template that you can use over and over. Now, on the style side, we do something similar. It's even easier. We take the entire transcript and we save that as a style, which really can be applied as a lens to any script. So, it'll make the script sound like the writing style from the reference as well as flow in a story structure in the same way. And I'm going to show you all this in action in a minute, but I just want to explain how the vault works and why it's so powerful at improving the AI scripting flow. The cool part with the vault is you can also manually add in your own hooks or your own styles. So, if you have a database of hooks and you don't want to go find a bunch of references in the videos tab, you can just take that database, save it as manual hooks, and then you've got that in the vault. Same thing with styles. If you have transcripts you've already written, save that in, and then that becomes a style preset that you can use. But here's where it really comes into play. Let me show you the scripting. When you want to script a new video, and this is step three, you go to the scripts tab, you press new script, and you get kicked into the flow. The first step, of course, is to add your prompt. This is where you describe what script you want to write. Now, Sastle does not require you to write a novel. All you really need is like three to six sentences. And what I recommend is just pasting in the topic and the angle that you wrote from steps one and two. You've already got that on your paper. You don't really even need to format it. just paste that into the prompt and press go. Sand Castle will then generate a full research report based on the prompt you gave it. Now, this report is going to drive the meat of what's in the script, the actual body of the script. So, you don't have to read it word for word, but you do want to scroll quickly and just glance through to make sure it's including the facts and takes that you wanted to. The sources that are used to drive that script are included in that carousel at the top. But if you want to change anything, delete anything, add anything, you just press the pencil and then you can add that in. Once you're good with the report, you press next. And here's where the vault pieces really come in. Step three in the workflow is the hook. And immediately you'll see that all of the hook templates you've saved in the vault, as well as a bunch that we include by default in Sandcastles are there in that carousel. If you click on one, it will generate two new hooks in the exact format as the template, but referring to the new topic that you're talking about for this script. And this is how we keep the exact hook structure consistently over and over, but give you the flexibility to use different hooks and generate different options. You can click the same Mad Lib a bunch of times to generate new pairs. You can also pick a bunch of different ones and you can basically build a set of 10, 12, 15 hook options in one spot to pick the best one. This is the fastest way to create new hooks that are in consistently validated formats without having to write them by hand. Now, once you pick a hook you like, you can move to the next step. And similarly, this is where we use the styles, but it's even easier because the styles are listed as template cards and you just click one and go. This will apply like a lens or a filter on top of the writing so that the style and flow works to match the example. Now once you click go on the style, the script will automatically start writing. It will use the prompt you gave. The body of it will include based on the research report. It'll use the hook that you've generated and the style. This is how you modularly use components that were validated to get the script to sound way better on the first rip. What we found is that this flow results in the most dialed first generation short form script in the world. Now, of course, the scripting process does not end here because typically I will spend 5 to 10 minutes cleaning this up by hand. The goal is to get this process to be automatic and hands-free every single time. And to be honest, in certain niches with certain templates, you can probably get there without touching it. For me, since I'm a perfectionist, I still like coming in and tweaking a couple words here and there. To solve for this in Sand Castles, the script editor literally works like a Google doc. You can read it, make adjustments, it'll save automatically. You could highlight sections and then use the prompt below that would just apply the edits to the highlighted piece and leave everything else alone. If you want to apply edits to the whole thing, highlight nothing and write those. You can change the length. You can swap the hooks. You can swap the facts. You can look and review the previous versions to see the diff mode to see what's changed. We've really built every piece of functionality you would want in the script writing experience in here. Even though the first generation is good 95% of the way out of the box, this AI plus human combo using the AI and preset template hooks and styles plus my own manual editing to go the last mile is my favorite workflow right now for script writing for short form content. Typically, this entire flow for the scripting takes about 5 to 10 minutes per script. And again, if you want to go full systemization, you could of course have your content operator do this as well. All right, step four is the recording. Now, today I'm not actually using any AI tools in my recording process. I might look robotic, but hopefully you can tell by these hands, I'm a human. And I'm not using AI in the recording because the costbenefit analysis doesn't really make sense for me. Despite not using a teleprompter and still reading my scripts one line at a time, the whole recording process for a short form video only takes me like 10 minutes. But the alternative, using an AI avatar with Hey Genen and a professional voice clone with 11 Labs, would only save me those 10 minutes. But the cost would be me having a much more robotic monotone delivery in my videos. Now, I know several creators that are fully AI generated when it comes to short form and it works really well. They don't even log into their Instagram. They have an editor somewhere. That editor has access to their AI avatar and literally just prints videos for them saying the script that they type in. Verun Maya, Rowan Chung, Nick Serev, they all do that and they're crushing when it comes to views in the tech and AI niche. But personally, I haven't been able to get this AI avatar, AI voice workflow working in a way that makes me feel like I'm still delivering at the quality and trust that people have known to expect. I will say a huge pro of figuring out AI automation is that it allows someone like your content operator to actually do the scripting and recording for you without you needing to log in. So today, I'm kind of a bottleneck in the human process. If I have a horse voice or my eyes are swollen, I then can't record and that slows everything down. But with the AI avatar stack, you don't really have that problem. you can always have the exact avatar delivery that you expect. So, for beginners, I don't recommend offloading the full recording process to an AI avatar. It's a lot to take on before you have all the rest of the variables dialed, but as you get better, if you really don't like this recording process and you want to save 10 minutes per rep, this is something you can look to include. All right, step five, the final step in the workflow is the editing. And before we get into the editing, let's just recap how much time we've saved in the workflow thus far by using this kind of like AI plus human system that I've walked through. If you're going fully manual without a content operator, you are currently at 1 hour per week on the ideation, 3 to five, 10 minutes max on the research, 10 minutes max on the script writing, and then 10 minutes on the recording. So, this is about 30 minutes total per rep before the editing, not counting the ideation, which is a lot of hours saved from how you were probably doing it before if you were manually doing everything. If you have a content operator and you're still recording manually, then the only time you're going to have to spend per rep is 10 minutes on the recording. If you have a content operator and you're using the AI avatar, so far you've spent zero minutes in this process at all. And this is really what true systematization looks like. Now, when it comes to editing, this is the final frontier. I predict we're going to have lots of people that have systematized this whole workflow up to the editing, but they're still going to need a human in the loop to do that last piece because there is not a great AI tool stack or workflow to do the editing automatic in the same way as the other things I've talked about. Now, there's a lot of startups trying to crack this, and there's a lot of pretty average automated editing tools, but none of it will cut above the quality line that I know you think you need. So, if you're trying to go full workflow optimization, you've really got two paths on the editing. Path one is to edit it manually yourself if you have no resources, but just time, but go with something lower, green screen, yap, fewer cuts, more value, more kind of like longer delivery to minimize the time in. These types of edits tend to work better on Tik Tok over Instagram, especially if you're in a highv value education niche. If you do this, each edit will probably take you 30 to 60 minutes. And obviously, you can scale that time up with more quality if you want all the whisbangs and flashes. Path two is to hire a human editor in the loop to do the editing for you. The harsh truth and reality is this. No content system is designed so that the creator is editing manually themselves. That's just not how you save the most time. And I totally empathize that everybody watching this is at a different stage. You may not have the resources to have an editor. You may have tried but have had it churn out. The reality is you're going to pay for the editing one way or the other. You're either going to pay with time or you're going to pay with money to buy back your time. So once you have the resources to buy back your time, you should do it because editing is the thing that you can replace and save the biggest chunk the quickest. Now, if you want to hire my editing team that does these YouTube videos and also every single one of my shorts, responsible for like billions of views on Short Form, I've got a link below where you can apply and I'll connect you with that exact team. But even if you don't, the last mile of your content workflow to really extract yourself out is going to be figuring out how to delegate away the editing from you. Now, as soon as there is an editing workflow that's feasible with AI, I will be the first one on this channel to tell you what it is, to show you, etc., but I don't expect that to come for a while. Now, one small tip I will say in terms of working with an editor to help empower them with AI. There are, of course, tons of AI image and video tools that can be really helpful for generating visuals used in your edits much faster. things like Nano Banana, Veo3, Cling 2.1, Midjourney, like these are all the staple tools for AI image and video. My pro tip for you and what we do on our team is have a virtual credit card that you give to each editor that allows them to go freely use and try any of the AI tool subscriptions that they want. This gives them the freedom to experiment and also builds into the workflow Veo3, Midjourney, Clling, all these tools that improve the quality of your edits and the speed that they can do it. So, it's not an automation workflow with respect to AI replacing them, but it is turning your human editors into 10x machines. So, there you have it. This is the latest and greatest as of today, my best five-step workflow for systematizing content with AI tools and different human processes to speed it up. I went from spending 4 to 6 hours, sometimes 8 hours per rep to spending only 15, 20, maybe 30 minutes max each rep myself. And then I have a team that's helping to fill the rest of the gaps. Again, everybody watching this is going to be in a different financial position, a different place in the journey. You may not have room for the editor. You may not have room for the content operator. Just know this. I personally spent the first 18 months, the first 300 reps editing myself. I did all of this myself manually and then I edited 6 to 8 hours. I couldn't free myself up to really fulfill my potential until I was able to hire myself out of the editing and move forward from there. So, as soon as you have the funds to be able to hire an editor and ultimately a content operator, I would do it. But even in the meantime, using tools like sand castles and chatbt will save you significant time, even if you're doing the manual editing yourself. As always, guys, I'm trying to bring the absolute best, the sauce, when it comes to content, right? I'm trying to be the guy for short form video and long form video that you look to that just gives so much value, you can't ignore the video. If that's you, if you're a business owner and you're trying to use content to grow, you know what to do. Make sure to subscribe to the channel, leave a comment, tell me what you want to see next.

trying to repurpose content to make one reel. Hours. Just sitting there,
rewatching a video, hunting for that one good clip. And by the end, I had honestly
wasted an entire afternoon. Then people started asking me,
so why don't you just use AI? No, thank you. And honestly, I thought
AI was just hype. Until I watched it
pull viral clips from a video in about
a third of the time it would have taken
me to just watch it. This changes everything. Now I am convinced and I am
here to convince you, too. I'm going to show you the best
AI tools for content creation. Turning one piece of
content into tons, so you can get back to
actually running your business. Here's what we're going to
be creating from one webinar recording. 5 to 10 video clips, one blog
post, 15 social graphics, and one email newsletter. I know what you're
thinking, but Stephanie, I run a small business. I'm not a content marketer. Trust me, I hear you. But you can do it with AI. And if you're not, you're
actually in the minority. We surveyed 500 small
business decision makers, and AI usage has
jumped 40% in one year, with 63% already
using it daily for stuff like content creation. So let's dive in and
I will show you how. OK, let's start with video. This is a recording from
a really awesome webinar we did with Google. You can actually watch that
in the description below. But if you're a
small business owner, use a how to video that you
found, or a morning show segment you were featured
on, or even a workshop that you've hosted. To turn this into social
video clips, open up Opus Pro and click Upload File. You can upload from your
desktop or paste a link. I'm going to grab
mine from the desktop. And now that it's
uploaded, you'll see options for how
the clips are made. Don't just click right away. Under Click Model,
for simplicity, we're going to choose Auto. For genre, I'm going to
select Webinar, since that's what I'm working with. And we want clips
that are 30 seconds. Then in the prompt
box, let's type, ""Find moments where the
speaker gives actionable tips for improving your
online presence."" And let's do a processing
time of about five minutes. Next, you can pick a
stock caption template from the quick presets tab. But I already built a custom
one that uses our brand colors. I think it's fun
that you can also add emojis to make them
super social friendly. And here we go, Opus Pro
just gave us dozens of clips. What I think is super cool
is that you can order them chronologically or
by virality score. This scores the
clip's hook and flow, and helps you predict which
ones will perform best. You can click Preview,
pick the best ones, and then just download an HD. Now, just because we have video
clips doesn't mean that's all we can do. This is one of the
best examples of how to use AI tools for
blogging, especially if you're not a writer. There are a lot of tools
out there that you can use. ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper. But for this example,
let's use Gemini. Instead of scribbling
notes from the webinar, I actually exported the video
transcript from Opus Pro and uploaded it into Gemini. Then let's prompt, ""What are the
five main takeaways from this webinar transcript?"" And there you have it,
Gemini will quickly give you the top five takeaways. From there, let's prompt again,
""Write a blog focusing on these five takeaways."" And just like that, Gemini
has generated a full draft. Now, here is the
really important part. Do not just copy and paste
whatever AI gives you. Always read through
it, make edits, and adjust the tone
so it sounds like you and matches your brand voice. Think of AI as a first
draft, not a final version. Once it looks
good, just hit copy and now you've got a ready
to publish blog post. Now let's promote that blog
with some social posts. First, open up ChatGPT. And again, I'm going to attach
the transcript from Opus Pro and then prompt with
something like, ""Give me 15 short social
media friendly tips for this webinar about
improving online presence for small business owners. Make them one-line tips I
can use as Instagram copy."" And voila, it'll
generate a list of tips. So go through them
carefully to make sure they're accurate, makes
sense for your audience, and once again, match your tone. If something feels
off or too stiff, you can ask ChatGPT to make
these more casual or more social friendly, and it'll
rewrite them for you. Once you're happy, just copy the
list into Google Sheets or Excel and clean it up by removing any
duplicates, fixing formatting, or adjusting any wording
that you want to fix. And now let's bring
these tips into Canva. Once you open Canva,
choose a template designed for quote posts or tips. Customize the fonts,
background, and colors to match your branding so
everything looks consistent. We want a pretty
grid here, folks. And here is where
the magic happens. Go to Apps and then Bulk Create. Upload your spreadsheet of tips. Select the text area where
you want your tips to appear, and select Connect Data. And then Canva will
instantly create a whole set of posts, one for each tip. Now, it may open these
in a new project. From here, you can
tweak the backgrounds or swap out images
to add variety, but keep the overall
style consistent. Bonus. If you're not sure how to
caption all these amazing posts, ChatGPT can help. Or even better, use AI that's
inside your social posting tool. For instance,
Thryv has CaptionAI that lets you prompt
and instantly generate three captions. You can even toggle options
to include hashtags and emojis or tailor the captions
to specific platforms. Seriously, the best
place to start using AI is within the products
you already use. It's a little less
overwhelming this way. So let's open up Keap
and build a newsletter to showcase the awesome
content we just built. So now that we're in the email
broadcast section of our Keap account, since I send
weekly newsletters, I'm just going to copy
my existing template and update the subject line. Now it's time to update to
promote our new content. For the headline, I will type
3 Tips to Get Found Online."" But honestly, we need
to make that punchier. Using Keap's integrated AI, I'll
click the AI suggestion tool and it's going to give me
three tips for enhancing your online presence. That's much better. Now, I want to add a
teaser from our blog post so readers get value
before clicking through. Instead of typing
everything out, I'm just going to paste my
notes and use the AI reformat tool to clean them up for me. Here's where it gets cool. Instead of boring
Read More buttons, Keap AI generates creative CTAs. I'll click Generate New
Buttons and get options, like Unlock Extra Tips. It's way more engaging
and more likely to get people to click through. You can even adjust the tone. Friendly, luxury, bold, witty,
depending on your brand voice. Now, I'm just going to
stick with friendly. And in the in case
you missed it section, I'll link to one of those
social videos we just made. After adding the content, I'll
run the grammar and spelling check to catch any mistakes,
which I am often guilty of. I'm going to make a few more
adjustments to the email, and then we're good to go. I didn't spend a
ton of time laboring over the right words and CTAs
that actually drive action. The smart text feature
saved me so much time, and now all that
content I worked on is available and going to be
sent right to my audience. And that's it. One idea, six tools, and
weeks of content in no time. I'm going to let you
in on a little secret. AI is not just for
content creation. No, small business
owners are already using it for things like
data analysis and customer engagement. In fact, most agree that AI
is no longer a nice to have. It is essential for
reaching new customers and thriving in today's
fast moving economy. And you'd be surprised
how much time and money they're actually saving
using it every single month. All of this is in
our report down in the description below, so

Thank you for supporting my channel so I can continue to provide you with free content each week!",AI tools for content creators,17533,1390,76,2025-10,"These are 10 AI tools that will save creators over 20 hours of their time every single week. All the tools we talk about today and timestamps will be linked down below. Tool number one is one that I've been using very actively every single week when I'm working and that is using Whisper Flow. This is a voicetoext AI tool that honestly instead of typing everything in Slack, responses to students, my team, emails, no matter where you are typing on your laptop, instead you just press two little buttons on your keyboard, you speak out loud and the AI automatically turns everything to text with proper grammar, punctuation, all the things. Yes, this tool is completely free and they also have an app version for your phone, but I use it mostly on my laptop. This is especially helpful when I'm scripting or outlining my YouTube videos and just like speaking my ideas out loud. I feel like speaking my ideas in real time helps me keep up with my thoughts faster instead of typing where I don't think my fingers can keep up with my brain as much. And I say that not because I'm a slow typer. I actually am very fast. I type very, very fast. But the two keyboards that I have are both just like wonky. the keyboard that is on my laptop, the Q button, doesn't work and it slows me down all the time when I'm typing and the Bluetooth keyboard that I have behind me. Sometimes the Bluetooth connection is lagging and so I'll start to type but then it glitches and it misses letters and so I have to backspace and like retry again. So honestly using the voice to text has been a game changer. Plus, Whisper Flow tracks all the words and time that you're saving every single time you use them. So, I think it's really really cool and has definitely helped my efficiency a lot when I'm working. The next tool is for like ideiation and brainstorming ideas. This is by using idea mapap.ai, which is also completely free. This is great if you're somebody who is more of a visual learner instead of like typing in a prompt into chat gpt and then having to like read a whole bunch of text, which can be a little overwhelming. So if you're somebody who loves visuals and creating like mind maps or outlines, this is something that you will absolutely love. Idea Map was initially created for teams to collaborate on ideas in real time. Like everybody can be on a board, add their ideas, connect the flow and the mind map. But for me, it was really fun to utilize this when I started kind of brainstorming what scaling my business would look like. I basically just typed in what my big goals were for my business and it gave me a great starting point of all the things that I needed to kind of work on or work towards to begin that scaling process. So if you're somebody who again you love the visual aspect of mind mapping idea map AI is definitely for you. AI tool number three this is specifically for video editing with your short form content and that's by utilizing submagic. Now, this one is absolutely crazy and honestly, I can't believe more people don't use it. Even myself, when I first came across Submagic, I was like, ""Wait, why are me and my team not using this?"" Because it makes editing short form content so so fast and effortless. And I am not just saying that because this video is also sponsored by Submagic. I actually already had this video outlined with Submagic in the outline as the suggested AI video editor and then I don't know manifestation weird they reached out and they're like hey we'd like to sponsor a YouTube video and I was like yes perfect actually I already have one outlined and you're in it. Do you want to sponsor that one? They're like yeah sure. So yes it's sponsored by Submagic but I was already going to mention them anyway. So, with Submagic, you upload your short form video footage, and you can seriously do so many different things with their platform. First, you upload your footage, and in the trim section, it makes editing down that raw footage and that first cut just seamless. It basically automatically removes silences, bad takes, and filler words. And then you could even like fine-tune those edits really seamlessly in their software. Then there's a caption section which is where you could really elevate your video because it will autodetect your captions or what you're saying and then create automatic effects for them. A lot of people are always asking me how I do closed caption in my videos and this is exactly how you could do it for yours. Now the game changer which I don't see a lot of people doing or a lot of softwares doing is they also have hook title as a feature. So basically based on your script, it will generate the perfect hook text for the first few seconds of your video. This is something that I teach as part of a master hook strategy is to have three hooks within the first three seconds. Text hook, verbal hook, audio hook. The verbal hook is what you say. So you already have that with your video and your closed captions. The text hook is text on screen that is complimenting what you're saying, and their AI automatically does that for you. They also have safe zones that you can toggle on or off so that you can feel really confident about placement of your text without the UI of like other platforms covering it up when you go to upload it. Now, if all of that wasn't mindblowing enough, they also have a B-roll tab where you could swap out certain sections of your script with B-roll that you could upload or they already have B-roll in their system that you can use. Like this video, I edited it in less than 10 minutes. I am not joking you. The original edit for that video took me over 4 hours. Now, if you're somebody who's thinking, well, I mostly focus on long- form YouTube videos. How can Submagic help me? Well, they also have a feature called Magic Clips where you can upload your YouTube videos. And Submagic will autodetect clips within that long form video to repurpose into short form and automatically clip out the best moments of that video. Once those are detected, of course, you can customize fine-tune those clips before posting. If you want access to truly the fastest and easiest way to edit viral style short form videos, then you could try Submagic for free with the link in the description. And if you choose to upgrade, you can get 10% off if you use the code milly10. Also, again, thank you so much Subag sponsoring this video. I could not believe how perfectly this worked out. AI tool number four is for my YouTubers out there. This is for editing that first cut of your long form video and that is by utilizing the tool GI AI. Now I have an active subscription with Gleing AI. I've been using it for over a year. I use it to edit all of my course videos because my course videos, they're long- form videos. What I do is I upload the raw footage to Gling AI. AI will scan the footage and automatically cut out pauses, mistakes, repeated sentences, h ands. So, it automatically does that first cut for you. That whole process, if you're not using AI to do that for you, that process alone could take you so much time, hours. Of course, once they have that cut version, you can fine-tune and tweak if you're like, ""Oh, I actually want to keep this mistake in there. I think it's pretty funny. So, you could always fine-tune it before you export, but basically, I want that first cut to be done by AI. And then when I'm happy with that, I'll export the video and then upload it to my preferred editor to continue editing that YouTube video. Gl, which is the one that I'm on. It's $10 a month for editing 10 hours of media. Now, speaking of YouTube, if you are a YouTuber or aspiring YouTuber, your goal is YouTube growth, then you absolutely need Vid IQ. You can sign up for VidIQ for free and then if you love it, then I believe you would pay for a subscription at $16.50 a month. And honestly, it might be like the only tool you would need as a YouTuber. Basically, Vid IQ will sync with your YouTube channel to help you with every part of your creative process from ideiation to posting. Their AI tools will help you identify trending keywords in your industry so that you could target those keywords and make evergreen search engine worthy videos. They also have the get video ideas tool. This will help generate video ideas for you every single day. They'll generate video ideas for you, ideally helping you get more viral worthy ideas. They even have a create thumbnail option so that you could start your thumbnail creation process in Vid IQ to get inspiration of like what your thumbnail could look like. They even have scripting for you. You tell them your video idea and they help script your video. And they even have an AI coach where you could ask the coach literally anything about your channel. Like you could type and be like, ""Hey, can you audit my YouTube channel?"" And it'll give you a YouTube audit. Vid IQ is no joke. It is another tool that I personally actively pay for and utilize all the time when I do my YouTube conceptualization and research for future video ideas. If you've learned something new so far, consider giving this video a thumbs up because it's going to tell YouTube that other creators like yourself will find this video helpful and valuable. And if you learn two new things by the end of this video, consider subscribing because it's a way to support my channel and help me continue to create free content like this for you every single week. Our sixth AI tool is for task management, time blocking, or calendar management. So, if you're somebody who loves time blocking and feels like your calendar could be a little bit more organized or even having an AI task management tool will help keep your busy days feel more seamless and structured so you're not forgetting about things that you planned, this one's for you. Now, originally, the tool that I was going to suggest to you is Acflow because it's really cool. While I do think it is the best tool all around for task management, time blocking, and just organizing your personal calendar with your business calendar, it's not free. And I really wanted to try to find a like free alternative for you because that's what we're all about. We're about saving money, especially as you're getting started. So, the best free alternative that I can find was Reclaim AI. Now, this syncs with your Google calendar, ClickUp Space, To-Doist, and other tools to add tasks to one singular calendar. You could even add your own custom time blocks for like lunch breaks or focus time or like morning workout. And it'll balance all personal and business tasks in one place. Now that I've started using Reclaim AI, my team has a better pulse and understanding of what my schedule looks like so that scheduling meetings aren't conflicting with personal plans like doctor's appointments or baby Jay's appointments. So, it's just nice to have everything in one place. So, not only am I staying organized, but my team understands what I'm working on, where I'm going to be, and they can schedule accordingly. Now, for Instagram, what is going to be the best AI tool to help you with your Instagram content? Our seventh AI tool is Stanley for IG. Stan literally has everything. Y'all know I talk about Stan in almost every single video because truly they are like the best all-in-one tool for creators, for making money, for getting content ideas, for all of the things. And they recently launched Stanley, which is an AI tool that integrates directly into your Instagram app. So you don't have to download anything else. You just connect Stanley for IG to your Instagram account and within your Instagram app, you can get AI generated content ideas based off of your current Instagram account and the content you're posting. Stanley for IG was recently launched and they're continuously adding new features. One thing that you could currently do is you could send a DM directly to Stanley and ask for content ideas. You could even send a real, you know, like if you're scrolling on the reals tab and you want to send a reel to your friend, you could send a reel that you like to Stanley and Stanley will look at that reel and tell you how you could apply it to your niche. So, if your goal is Instagram growth, but you're constantly struggling with coming up with ideas, Stanley is going to be your best friend. AI tool number eight is mostly for teams. It's something that I'm currently integrating into my business, but because I'm currently integrating it, I wanted to talk about it. And that is helping you maintain your brand voice across all marketing content, email newsletters, blog posts, YouTube videos, Instagram captions, all the things. And the tool that I'm going to be talking about is Hire Mia. It is a free tool and it's a great way to make sure your brand voice stays consistent across all platforms. One of my goals internally for my business right now is creating a consistent brand voice across all platforms that I post. We are doing great at that right now. But the issue that we keep running into like my team and I is that I am always the bottleneck holding my team back from taking action. Because right now I am reviewing every piece of content before it goes out. from like our email newsletters to blog posts to Instagram captions, new website, landing pages, sales pages, email funnels. I have like a review day in my calendar where like, okay, every Thursday I'm going to review all the content for my team. And it always takes me six plus hours to just review what other people did and be like, yes, this is approved. Or, can we actually tweak this? This doesn't sound like me. Such a waste of time. You know what I mean? So, being able to have an AI tool that understands my voice where my team can then upload their drafts, their Instagram captions to that tool and have that tool finalize and review. It saves me so much time every single week, but also empowers my team to take action and quick action. So, right now I'm playing around with different brand voice tools like Hire Mia so that we can basically skip my review process and allow my team to utilize an AI tool to give them that confidence to post and continue to create for me. AI tool number nine can help content creators with content planning, ideiation, but also creating like an actual content calendar of what to post, when to post, and being more strategic with posts. And that is by utilizing chatbt. I know. I know. I really tried to not mention chat GBT, but I feel like with almost everything I was talking about, I was like, ""Oh, chat GBT could help with that. Oh, chat GBT can help with that."" So, I'm just going to mention it one time. Obviously, you could use chat for literally anything. But simplifying it for this purpose, asking ChatGBT a question like, ""Can you help me plan out next month's content calendar? I want to post X times a week on said platform talking about these topics. List your topics. Then you say something like, please tie in a variety of viral worthy content, search enginebased content, potential seasonal content ideas, trending content, and also leave room for some spur-of-the- moment creative freedom content. Boom. from Shakaaka chat's going to spit out a whole content calendar for you telling you exactly what to post, when to post it, and if they're like, ""Okay, here's the list of ideas. Just be like, ""Thank you for these ideas. Can you plug this into calendar format for me for between the dates of November 1st and November 30th?"" I have a whole video on chat GDT prompts that creators can use to help them grow to 1 million followers. So, you could definitely watch that video after this one. But I also, if you just want to skip watching a video and you just want to go straight to having all of the prompts mentioned in that video, I have a free downloadable. It is chat GPT prompts for creators and it'll give you literally everything that you need to brainstorm with Chat GBT about your goals and helping you get there as a content creator. So, I'll leave that linked down below. It is amazing. We love chatb here. AI tool number 10 helps you with deep content research and that is by utilizing Perplexity AI which is also a free tool. Now, Perplexity AI is a research tool that helps students and academics find peer-reviewed sources, deep dive into topics, and back everything up and all of your research up with credible citations. Basically, if you need reliable info, it pulls insight straight from trusted sources. So, how is this different from ChatBT? Chatbt is great for creative stuff, maybe brainstorming, Instagram captions, having natural conversations where you kind of talk back and forth and brainstorm ideas. Perplexity, on the other hand, is more of an answer engine for real time research, factchecking, and giving you answers backed up with sources and citations. So, if I am scripting a deep dive video for my YouTube channel on influencer marketing and how it's growing, how it's grown over the past few years, it's the future of influencer marketing and how creators are getting paid, how brands are budgeting for influencer marketing in their business, like all of that research. I would do that in perplexity over chat GPT because I want to make sure that I'm pulling from actual trusted sources instead of just being like, ""Hey chat, oh my gosh, do you know the answer to this?"" Yeah, you could do that on Google, but you have to like scroll through Google and be like, ""Okay, is this a trusted source?"" It's just like SEO based. You get to save that time of like scrolling on Google and seeing like, ""Is this a trusted source?"" You don't have to do that. You just type your questions into Perplexity and it will automatically pull information from trusted sources. Next, what I want you to do is watch this video next because YouTube thinks you'll like it and I will see you next week. Thanks so much for watching. Follow your joy. Bye."

#HubSpot",AI tools for content creators,37610,1456,164,2025-08,"I gave myself 1 hour to turn one single idea, just 
one, into 20 highquality content assets across   46 posts that I can use on every major platform 
and turn into revenue. No fancy setup, just me,   my laptop, Dcript, and some free AI tools. The 
goal was to prove that you don't need more ideas,   you need a system. And yes, I did film the 
whole challenge, and I walk you through   the exact workflow I follow, step by 
step, so you can learn how to do it,   too. We're talking a podcast episode, a YouTube 
video, short form clips, carousels, blog posts,   newsletters, LinkedIn content, even a lead magnet, 
ebook, and a course outline, all created from one   15-minute video. And don't drop off early 
because at the end, I'm going to show you   how you can use AI to turn all of these pieces of 
content into revenue generating assets so you can   make some money. If you want the step-by-step 
breakdown of how I planned this whole thing,   you're going to want to grab the AI content 
creation checklist from HubSpot. It's free   and it's linked right below in the description. 
This is a super actionable checklist that walks   you through how to implement AI at every stage of 
content creation from brainstorming all the way   to analytics. I used it to plan this whole entire 
workflow and I'll show you how it works in real   time. So, if you're a creator, an entrepreneur, 
or a marketer who's tired of the content grind,   this is the video that you want to take notes 
on. Let's roll the tapes. [Music] All right,   we have one hour to create content. Time starts 
now. So, the first thing that I'm going to do is   create one long form video that's going to be able 
to be repurposed into tons of different kinds of   content. I'll just make it around 15 to 20 minutes 
long. The key to fast content creation is not to   overthink it and let AI handle the heavy lifting. 
I'm going to do this on dscript.com on the web,   but you can also download the app onto your 
computer to make it an easier process. And   I'm going to use the paid version. You can 
start with the free version, but I recommend   to upgrade to a paid version eventually just 
to get all of the fun tools and features. So, new project, video project. So, here you 
can upload a past video and then follow all   of the steps that I'm going to show you to give 
it a second life. But as part of the challenge,   I'm going to record fresh content to use. Now, 
in dscript, you can also invite others to join   the recording. This is great if you want to do a 
conversational piece or an interview style video.   You can also just record yourself speaking to 
the camera, which is what I'm going to do for   this challenge. Showing up on camera is one of 
the best ways to build trust with your audience,   which is why I'm taking this approach to content 
creation. So, I'll head into the project,   and the first thing we want to do is brainstorm. 
AI tools, scroll down, write an outline. So,   for the starting point, I'm going to include 
what I want to talk about and what to include   in the script. So, I'm going to write how to 
avoid burnout as a busy business owner creating   content. And I want to include my personal story 
and then five tips, both mental and physical,   to save time and actually enjoy the content 
creation process. Perfect. Audience, I'm going   to write busy small business owners juggling a 
ton of tasks and struggling to find time to show   up online. And then for custom instructions, I'm 
going to write I want the video to be at least   15 minutes long. and include prompts to fill 
in the blanks with my own knowledge. That way,   it's not just completely writing a script 
for me. It's prompting me to think off the   cuff about something that I could talk about. All 
right, let's see what it comes up with. That looks   like a nice outline. Lots of spots for me to fill 
in the blanks. Perfect. If you want to change it,   you can just select follow up, write another 
prompt, and it will adjust accordingly. But for   the sake of time, I'm just going to go with this. 
So, I'm going to select add to script. [Music] Okay, the next step is to just get on camera and 
talk following the outline. You can get as fancy   as you want with this by adding an external 
microphone or using a DSLR camera. But you   can also keep it really simple and just use your 
webcam built into your computer and your built-in   computer mic. There are a ton of AI tools that 
will help clean up the audio after the fact,   which I'll show you when we get to the 
editing process. Remember that done is   better than perfect. Now, if you mess up while 
you're recording your video, I suggest going   back to the beginning of the sentence that 
you messed up on rather than the word that   you messed up on. This is going to let the line 
flow naturally once you cut out that mistake. So,   I'll go to record camera. You can choose to use a 
teleprompter here, which is super helpful if you   want to look at the camera while you're recording. 
However, there is an AI tool to adjust your eye   gaze so that it looks like you're looking at the 
camera even if you're looking off screen. I'll   show you that shortly. Here, you would choose 
your mic and your camera that you want to use.   And then I'll select record into script. And here 
we go. Hey everyone, Bridget here. I'm the owner   of Bridget's Blueprint. And today I want to talk 
about something that many of us struggle with,   burnout, especially as business owners who 
spend a significant amount of time creating   content. Subscribe to the channel. Make sure 
to tell your friends if you found this video   helpful. And I will see you next week. Bye. 
All right. I just finished the recording.   It's probably going to take a little bit of time 
to process and transcribe, but hopefully not too   long cuz we are at time check 44 minutes. 
Oh, wow. All right, it's ready. That was   fast. Let's work on this together. So, the first 
thing that I want to do, I'm going to use a bunch   of AI tools just to clean up this recording and 
get it ready to go. So, head up to AI tools. So,   I'm going to use edit for clarity to remove 
filler words, rambling, unwanted noise, fluff,   stuff like that. So, I'll submit that. So, it has 
a bunch of suggestions here. So, I am just going   to select done and those will all be taken out 
of the final recording. I'll select studio sound   and this is going to make the sound sound studio 
quality in just one click. Now, I'm also going to   go into visual effects and I'm going to use this 
eye contact button because I wasn't looking at   the camera the whole time because I was reading 
off the outline. This is going to adjust my gaze   so it looks like I was looking at the camera the 
whole time. Kind of freaky that you can do this,   but let's do it. Something else that you can do is 
remove retakes. So, if you did start a sentence,   mess up, and go back to the beginning of the 
sentence, it's going to take out your mess up. So,   we'll do that and select done. There are also 
a ton of other tools that you can use here   and play around with. And if you want to edit it 
manually, what's really cool with the description of the transcript, press delete, and that 
section will be deleted out of the final   video. This is called textbased editing, and it's 
a super efficient way to edit your videos. Okay,   so I'm going to keep this pretty simple 
for the sake of time, but you can also   design the video with your fonts, captions, 
with logos, colors, all that fun stuff. So,   let's export this to the computer. I'll head up 
to export video. What's cool, you can actually   export this directly to your YouTube channel, 
which will save you a ton of time. But for now,   I'm just going to do local export and export the 
video. Okay, while that's exporting, let's create   a YouTube description and podcast show notes 
using AI. You'll see these options available   under AI tools. Draft YouTube description or draft 
show notes. So, let's start with draft YouTube   description. So, you can put examples of your past 
YouTube descriptions in here so that it will draft   it sounding like you. There we go. It even comes 
with chapter markers. So cool. Okay. So, we have   that. We can copy and paste that into the YouTube 
description. And then I'm also going to create   show notes. Perfect. Okay, so now we have two 
pieces of content. A YouTube video, which you can   upload to YouTube with your YouTube description, 
and a podcast episode, which you can upload on a   podcast hosting site like Spotify for podcasters, 
and use the show notes for the description. [Music] Now, the guide that I mentioned at 
the beginning of the video does mention that   repurposing your content is one of the best 
ways to get the most out of your ideas. So,   let's do it. We're going to create three 
mediumlength videos from that long- form   video. Think about 3 to five minutes long. And 
these can be posted on YouTube to redirect to the   full length video and also on LinkedIn as thought 
leadership videos. So in script head to AI tools,   create clips. Our number of clips, we're going to 
do three. And the clip duration about 200 seconds   long, 3 to 5 minutes. We'll turn off this layout 
option. You can even write the goal of what you're   trying to create clips of so that it will select 
clips accordingly. But we're just going to press   submit and see what it comes up with. You'll 
see that I now have three clips with titles   and descriptions of what the clips are about. I'm 
going to add captions to them by selecting this   captions button. I'll choose a style that I like. 
It's going to take a second to apply the captions.   Great. So, you can actually edit these captions. 
You can upload your own font or you can choose one   of these fonts. The size, the color, the effects, 
the animation, all that stuff. I'm just going to   keep it simple for this video. So, I just added 
captions to all three of those videos. And then   I am going to export all three items. These can 
be used on YouTube, LinkedIn, even Facebook.   But make sure to redirect to the fulllength 
video in anywhere that you post these. [Music] Next up, we want to make some short form 
clips from this video that you can use   across any vertical social media platform like 
Instagram reels, Facebook reels, YouTube shorts,   Tik Tok, LinkedIn video. I'm going to do this 
the same way we created the medium clips with   a few little tweaks. So, back in AI tools, I'll 
go to create clips. This time, we're going to   create five clips under 60 seconds. We'll turn 
the layout tab back on and select one of these   layouts that we like. I'm going to select 
this one. Press submit. Now you'll have   five vertical social media clips with captions 
already on them that again you can adjust the   style to fit your brand. Download all of these 
in bulk and they are ready to schedule and post.   So with five short clips across five social 
media channels, that's 25 posts right there.   And it took us what? 2 minutes. Time check. We 
are at 31 minutes left. We're getting there. So, we have tons of video now, but the content 
doesn't stop there. That one idea can be made   into tons of other content. Let's move on to 
graphics. Next, we're going to create a carousel,   which is basically a bunch of photos or 
graphics that are posted together. These   can be posted on Instagram and cross-osted to 
your Facebook page if you have the two connected,   or you can post them both separately. For 
this, we're going to use Canva Magic. So,   here I'm in my Canva account. I'm going to select 
social media Instagram post. So, I went to design   and here I typed carousel with five tips for busy 
business owners trying to create content without   burning out. Let's see what it creates. Now, I've 
already set up my brand in Canva. So, under brand,   I'm just going to select my brand style, see 
results, and you'll see I'll get tons of different   templates that I can either download right away, 
which I'm going to do for the sake of time,   or you can sit down and edit these to fit your 
brand style. Now, in the AI content creation guide   that I mentioned at the beginning of the video, it 
does mention collaborating with AI while you guide   the overall strategy. So, you always want to read 
through anything that AI creates and adjust it to   fit your voice. Next up, I'm going to create 
a quote graphic. This is a great way to give   people a peak into your content and share some 
wisdom or some humor on places like Instagram,   Facebook, and LinkedIn. So, back on the Canva 
homepage. So, I'm going to create an Instagram   post. In the design section, I'm going to write 
quote graphic that says that you don't have to be   a full-time content creator to show up online. 
Now, I'll just select brand. Select my brand   colors. And tons of options are created. Change 
your favorite one to match your brand colors.   And voila. You can actually create a ton of 
these to fill up your content calendar. [Music]   Okay, we have got a ton of content already. Let's 
move on to some textbased content. First up,   a blog post for your website. So, head back to 
Dcript AI tools. You can scroll down to draft   a blog post. Here you can put an example of past 
blog post so that it will write it according to   your tone, your length, your style. And you can 
also add custom instructions which I will add.   Use lots of bullets and headers for easy reading. 
When it's ready, you can copy it and you can paste   it right into your blog and then edit the format 
to look nice. Now, make sure to link to the long-   form YouTube video at the end of this blog post 
and link to this blog post in your YouTube video   description to cross-promote each other. Now, what 
about your email list? You can turn this into a   whole email series if you wanted to. For the sake 
of time, we're just going to create one email   for this. Back in Dscript, I'll head to export 
transcript and I'm going to download it in plain   text format. Head over to chatbt and upload that 
file. I'll write the prompt, turn this into an   email newsletter for my audience of busy business 
owners that discusses avoiding burnout in content   creation and directs to the complimentary YouTube 
video at the end. Nice. That was super fast. Okay,   so I'm just going to copy this and then you 
can copy and paste it into your email marketing   software. I use HubSpot. I highly recommend it 
if you don't have an email marketing software   already. It's a great all-in-one platform that 
manages your contacts and allows you to send out   email workflows super easily. Okay, if you don't 
know already, right now, one of the best ways to   grow on LinkedIn is LinkedIn newsletters. So, in 
the same chat, I'm going to write turn this into   a LinkedIn newsletter. So, that can just be copy 
and pasted right into your LinkedIn newsletter.   Remember to always edit it to fit your brand 
voice. Now, you'll also need a header image for   this. This can be super easy to create on Canva 
using Canva Magic with the same workflow that I   showed you earlier. Now, if you want to learn more 
about LinkedIn newsletters and how to set this   up and grow it, I'm going to link a video for you 
in the description to watch next. Now, we haven't   even hit up X yet. So, in my chatb chat, I'll 
prompt it to create an X thread that breaks down   what was discussed in this video. You can then 
turn this into a thread on your ex account. Last   but not least, let's do a LinkedIn post. Sometimes 
on LinkedIn thought leadership posts with no links   actually get the most views. So in the same chat 
with JBT, I'm going to prompt it to create a   LinkedIn post that will encourage conversation 
around this topic with my network. There you   go. Ready to post and engage. [Music] All right. 
Now we've created 17 pieces of content across 46   posts on social media. But now, let's make this 
content work for me because visibility is great,   but what I really want is visibility that leads 
to revenue. We've still got 10 minutes left. So,   let's talk about how to take everything that 
we've just made and turn it into something that   can actually grow your email list, sell products, 
or book clients. So, back in the chat GBT chat,   I am going to type turn this into a downloadable 
checklist that helps the audience implement their   learnings. Great. So now you can either take this 
and put it into Canva and design it to fit your   brand or for the sake of time I'll just write turn 
this into a PDF and then ChachiBT will create it   for me. Okay, so this is pretty boring looking. 
I mean for the sake of time we'll take it. But I   highly recommend making it look a little prettier. 
So this is called a lead magnet. The idea is   to link it in newsletters, social media posts, 
emails, YouTube descriptions, podcast episodes,   you name it. Then the audience can download it 
for free in exchange for their email address.   And then that information can be used to market 
the next stage of your funnel to them. Literally   every post that we've made so far can point back 
to this freebie. And that's how you start building   a content system that grows your email list. 
For the next stage of my funnel, I want to offer   something valuable for a small price. Think like 
$7. The idea is that someone downloads my freebie   and then I have their email address to follow up 
and be like, ""Hey, if you want to go even deeper,   I have another offer for you."" So I'll prompt 
chat to BTT. I'll say turn this video into an   ebook that helps the audience go deeper on the 
subject. So now I can take this and I can use an   AI tool like ebookmaker.ai to design it. Obviously 
a little bit more work goes into this section,   so I won't do it now, but it's on the list. 
Now we're into the final stage of my funnel,   my high ticket product. I'm going to make this a 
course. The idea here is that somebody downloads   my ebook and then I upsell them to my course, 
which costs a little bit more. So, in my chat GPT   chat, I'm going to say, ""Turn this video into a 
course outline with three to five modules, titles,   and lesson descriptions."" You can use the original 
video that you created as like a case study,   or a teaser to promote this course to your 
audience. Either way, everything that you've   created so far, a podcast episode, a YouTube 
video, short form clips, medium length clips,   LinkedIn posts, email newsletters, etc., can be 
repurposed again and again to promote this paid   offer or at least lead people into your funnel. 
Every single post that you've created isn't just   content. It is a pipeline into your lead magnet, 
your products, or your next offer. This is where   content stops being just a to-do list and starts 
becoming part of your business engine. And look   at this. We have 2 minutes to spare. Man, that 
was a lot of content. I'm going to use a social   media scheduler to schedule this out across my 
social media channels. I assume it'll probably   take about an hour to do, which isn't too bad. You 
can use a tool like HubSpot social media or later,   Buffer, Metricool. There are a ton out there, 
and a lot of them actually come with AI tools   to help with captions, hashtags, and even posting 
times based on when your audience is online. There   we go. Everything is scheduled out over the next 
month for my social media channels. That's a lot   of content. And that all came from one idea in 
one 15inute video. That's pretty crazy. I feel   accomplished. I'm going to go take a nap. And 
that's it. 20 content assets, 46 total posts,   one idea, and just 1 hour. Honestly, if you told 
me a year ago that I could build an entire content   system like this in a single sitting, I would have 
rolled my eyes. But here we are. Proof it works.   So whether you're a solo creator, a small business 
owner, or a marketer trying to do more with less,   I hope this challenge gives you some inspiration 
and a repeatable workflow that you can actually   use. And just remember, you don't need to be 
everywhere. You need a smart way to be in the   right places more often with content that fuels 
your business. If you want the full step-by-step   breakdown, don't forget to grab the AI content 
creation checklist from HubSpot. It's completely   free and it's the same framework I used to 
plan this challenge from start to finish.   The link is right below. If this video helped 
you out, give it a like, drop a comment with   your favorite takeaway, and subscribe for

If you're brand new to my channel, hi, my name is Ineri and over here we talk about content creation, digital marketing, and everything online business. And if that is something that you want to learn more about, consider subscribing. The reason I wanted to create this video is because I know a lot of you want to get started on your creator journey, but you don't know that there are completely free tools out there to help you get started. So, what I want to do is I want to break down the content creation process and then give you the exact tools that I use when I first got started. So, let's get into it. So, the very first step of the content creation process is content ideation. This is basically the content idea or the video topic that you will be covering in your content. So, there are different ways to find content ideas and there are so many different tools out there that make this possible. And by far my favorite and the most free and best tool out there is Chad GBT. And I know ever since Chad GPT got released a few years ago, it has come so far and it can be a very powerful tool. So, in order to get started with Chad GGPT, all you have to do is go to chatgpt.com and create a free account. And then I'm just going to quickly go over pricing. So, you can see if you go to openai.com and then chbpt/pricing, you can see that Chad GPT has a completely free version for anyone to use. And they do have a uh plus version that is about $20 a month, but the free version is more than enough. And one other thing that I do want to point out, um, when it comes to content ideation with AI tools, I don't want you to jump into the AI tool straight ahead and say, ""Hey, give me content ideas for my business."" I know a lot of people do it that way. If you want to get tailored content ideas that is unique to your industry and your business, you need to give Chad GPT a little bit more context about what you want it to create for you. So, I highly recommend you watch my video about six different ways to find unlimited content ideas for your business. I did do a very deep dive about what type of prompts to give and also the five other free ways to find content ideas for your business. So, if you missed that tutorial, I will link it in the description below for you to check it out. So, now that you have all these different content ideas, the next stage is to organize all these ideas in one centralized location. And this is a step I highly recommend you not to skip because when I first got started, I used to plan everything on my notes app on my phone. And then as I started creating more and more content, it just got so much harder for me to manage. So from my notes app, I shifted to using Google uh Google Sheets. And then that soon became very um hard to manage too. Then I shifted to the third free tool that I'm about to show you which I have been using for years. And this free tool is called Notion. And I have been using Notion for quite some time now. And it is by far my go-to tool when it comes to content organization and keeping everything in one centralized hub for my business. Now, let's quickly look at the pricing section of Notion. So, if you go to notion.com/pricing, you can see that they do have a completely free version for you to test out. At the time of recording this video, uh, and then this is more than enough for you to get started. I used the free version of Notion for the longest time when I was like brand new to content creation. And then as I started to monetize my content, I shifted to the paid version. So, even the paid version, you can see it's quite affordable. It's only $10 per month if you're on the annual plan. And if you pay monthly, it's about $12 per month per member. So, uh the only downside to the free version of Notion is that if you're not on the paid version, you don't get like unlimited storage. So, if you want to like add your videos to notion, uh you might not uh you know be able to do that because you will hit a limit. So, a workaround for this is if you like connect your Google Drive to Notion, you can do that by just adding a link. You can host all your videos on your Google Drive for free and then add it add it to notion as a backup. So, uh let me quickly walk you through uh what my notion looks like so you have a visual idea of like what is possible when you start using notion for content creation. So, uh this is my content hub for notion. I've done many tutorials on how I use notion as a creator and if you want to like go uh deep into it, I will link it in the description below for you to check it out. But uh basically notion allows me to see like all my content across multiple platforms in one centralized location. So uh notion allows you to create something called databases and this is like the master database that I have created for all my different platforms and this is a different view. So this is a content calendar that I created just for Tik Tok and then you can see I have one created for Instagram. I have one for YouTube and all the different platforms that I'm creating content on. So right now if you're just getting started this might seem overwhelming for you because you're just like trying to get started with posting content on one platform and inner you're showing me like 100 different platforms. No, you don't have to be on all these platforms. I just wanted to show you the possibility with notion as you use it more as you evolve as a content creator and you know post on multiple different platforms. So, just to kind of make things easier for you, I've created a free notion content calendar. Uh, so that you know, if you're just getting started, you have your content ideas with all the methods that I teach you on my channel. Next stage is for you to organize all these ideas, you can just get my free content calendar, build on notion, and just add all those ideas on there and then move on to the next stage. And then uh the other thing is notion can also be a very helpful tool in keeping track of what you need to post and when. So let me show you what I mean. So I've created notion uh dashboards for every single platform that I'm on. So let's say that you're going to start creating content on Tik Tok first or YouTube for an example. So, what I highly recommend you do is go to notion, create a free account, and then create a page just for Tik Tok and then add all your content ideas that need to go for the week or the month. So, this is my Tik Tok page inside of Notion. You can create whatever you like for your business or whatever platform that you're creating content on. And the best part about Notion is that you can customize it to however you like. So this is what my page for Tik Tok looks like. So this has everything I possibly need to create content on Tik Tok in one centralized location. And that is what I love about Notion. I can quickly access my Tik Tok profile over here. I can get access to analytics in a click of a button. So I don't have to waste my time going to Google or typing anything in. It's all housed inside of my notion dashboard. And you can customize this to, you know, whatever you like. I just like my things to look a lot more visual because I'm a very visual person. Uh and then I have all the list of ideas for the week. And then these are all the videos that I posted. So, um if you want to see uh a little bit more detail about what my workflow looks like and a full tour of my notion system, uh I'll put that video in the description below for you to check out. So now that you have the perfect free tool to plan and organize your content, the next stage in the content creation process is the actual creation of the content. So I look at content creation in two different aspects. I look at content creation for video and then content creation for graphics. So, for recording your content, I know a lot of people get stuck on what perfect camera should I use, what perfect gear do I need, and you chase all the tech stuff and you don't even record and post a video because you're just so overwhelmed with all the different information that's out there. So, I want you to move as fast as you can and post your first 50 videos on social media. So, what I highly recommend you do is just use your smartphone. And right now, we're living in the best time possible to get started in content creation because we have access to things that people 50 years ago didn't even have access to. And I'm talking about your smartphone. So, when it comes to content creation, you don't need a expensive fancy camera. If you have a smartphone with a decent camera in it, that is more than enough. I actually still record most of my content for my short form content using my uh old iPhone and I have like the old iPhone 13. I don't even have the latest one and I still use this to record all my video content for Tik Tok, YouTube shorts, Instagram res, you name it. So use what you have and don't stress about things that you don't have and be resourceful. So, when it comes to uh putting video out there, one of the biggest mistakes I made is my videos were super dark because I didn't have proper lighting. So, this video is about completely free tools to get started in content creation. So, I'm not going to tell you to go on Amazon and buy a ring light. Uh but those are available and it's very affordable, too. But if you don't even have the budget for a ring light, what I highly recommend you do is stand in front of a window and use natural light. Sometimes natural light can be a lot better than even a ring light. So use what you already have and don't make excuses to get started. So, now that you have natural light and a camera using your phone to record your content, uh let's look at the two best softwares that are out there that is completely free to use when it comes to video editing and then graphic design. So, for video editing, what I personally love and use is Cap Cut. And Cap Cut does have a completely free version for you to get started. And I have many many tutorials on my YouTube channel that shows you how to use Cap Cut. So if you missed that, please check the content creation tips playlist on this channel. And then um if you want an alternative for Cap Cut that is equally good. What I highly recommend is InShot. So for me, I use both Cap Cut and InShot in my tutorials. So they do have free versions that you can get started today. And then the next uh area of content creation is actual graphics. So this includes uh any type of post that is not a video. So there's no movement on it. So this can be a single graphic post or a carousel post. And the best tool that I highly recommend you use that is completely free for beginners is Canva. And I'm pretty sure you know you know what Canva is by now if you have watched any of my other tutorials on my channel. I created over 500 free Canva tutorials for you. So if you're just getting started on Canva and you have no idea how to use it, I want you to watch my tutorials, binge it so that you can start learning Canva today. So one of the biggest questions I get in most of my Canva tutorials is, are you using the pro version of Canva? Can this be done on the free version? Well, there are a lot of benefits in getting the pro version of Canva, trust me, I have been using Canva Pro for years now, but if you only have access or you only have the budget for the free version of Canva, there are a few workarounds and I made a video about what to do if you're on the free version. I'll link it in the description below for you to watch that. But Canva is an excellent tool for you to not just create like social media graphics for your business, but create other content. uh promotional content for your website, landing pages. You can even create like really nice graphics for your digital products, create your digital products all inside of Canva. So, you can like not just create content for social media, but also create digital products to monetize social media. So, um that is all possible inside of Canva. So now that we have the tools to find content ideas, organize content ideas, and create your content, let's go to the next stage of your content creation process, and that is scheduling your content. So the difference between content creators who start posting and then give up after a few posts versus content creators that are established, have been doing this for a long time, is consistency. And I know sometimes this word might sound a little cringe because everyone talks about consistency, but then how do you become consistent? Like no one talks about how you stay consistent. So I've been posting content for years and I post pretty consistently and that is possible by using the right tools. And since this video is about free tools for you to get started, I'm gonna show you the exact tool that I use. Even the free version I used for the longest time. And then now I'm on the pro version, but it is Metrole. And this is a social media scheduling tool that allows you to schedule your content across multiple different social media platforms in one centralized location. So if you go to metricle.com/pricing, you can see the different pricing tiers that they have. So, I am located in the United States. So, I'm going to click on USD. And you can see that they do have a completely free version. So, $0 a month for life. And in their free version, they have up to 50 posts a month at the time of recording this video. So, depending on where you're at, what your budget is, Metro is an excellent tool to start. Uh, and then I do have a completely like broken down tutorial on how to use Metricool. I'll link it in the description below so that you can uh see how to use it. But let me just show you how I use Metriccool. So, um, this is just my content calendar for the week. Uh, and I use Metrocool to plan my content across multiple platforms. And you can see that, you know, all of this is possible because I'm using this tool. So all I then have to do is create uh content for my primary platform which is Tik Tok and then I use that video and then I use Metrocool to schedule it out to all these other social media platforms. So by doing this I am not on my phone all day posting. I'm not you know trying to do all of this manually. I just use the power of automation and these tools to make it possible. And metrical is free for you to get started. All right. Now that we know the best content creation tools that are out there for beginners. So the next question you might have is okay in you told me the best tools. I'm excited to get started but there are so many different social media platforms out there. What platform should I post my content in? Like what should I what should I get started with? So to answer that question I want you to ask yourself these three things. So you need to first identify like who you're speaking to. You need to identify your target audience and then see what platform they're congregating the most. Like what is the platform that they hang out the most? Is it YouTube? Is it Tik Tok? Is it Meta? Like you need to have an idea of that. So once you have an idea of what that platform is, then I want you to focus on just one platform. When you're first getting started and you're brand new to content creation, it's going to be very difficult for you to chase two rabbits at the same time. So, get better at creating content for one platform and then once you hit 100 posts, then you can decide if you want to diversify to the next one. So, for me personally, I started off with Tik Tok. I got comfortable talking to the camera. I got comfortable, you know, creating videos, editing videos, creating graphics. And as I got better every single day with every single post, I decided that I had the bandwidth and the capability to diversify to other platforms. So then I started with YouTube, I started with Meta, Pinterest, all those other platforms. But it started because I took that leap of faith to go and chase one platform. And next, I want you to look at social media platforms in terms of content monetization. meaning what platforms pay creators to post content. So right now there are three of my favorite platforms that pay creators really well for posting content. So number one on that list and my personal favorite is YouTube. So YouTube has been uh paying creators to create content for the longest time now. So if you want to monetize not just your short form content but also your long- form videos uh you know YouTube has a very good content monetization program. And the next best social media platform to monetize your content is obviously Tik Tok. Tik Tok has been launching a lot of content monetization opportunities for creators. And when I say creators, I'm talking about creators in the United States. I know there are some limitations for creators outside the US, but if you are a US-based content creator, Tik Tok has a lot of amazing opportunities. So, just to name a few of the programs that they have, they have something called Tik Tok shop for creators. So, this is basically where you talk about a product that you purchased on Tik Tok shop uh on your video and you link that product in the video itself. So, if somebody purchases through your link, you get um an affiliate commission that's paid inside of Tik Tok. I know YouTube has something very similar to that right now. So, that's called Tik Tok shop on the Tik Tok app. And then they also have something called uh Tik Tok creator rewards program. And this is a program that I'm personally on. And this is where you get rewarded for content that you post on Tik Tok that is within Tik Tok guidelines. Um, and if you uh get,000 views for any video that's over a minute long. So, you get paid depending on what your RPM is, but basically you get paid to create content on Tik Tok. And then two other programs inside of Tik Tok include uh subscriptions. So if you have a certain number of followers on Tik Tok, you can uh turn on subscriptions uh where people can pay you a monthly subscription and you create premium exclusive content just for them. And then also something called creator marketplace and this is where you connect with other brands to either create content for them as branded content or UGC content. So, if you want like a video where I dive deep into what all of these mean, let me know in the comments below and I'll make a dedicated video. But, uh, Tik Tok has incredible opportunities to monetize your content if you are a creator on the platform. And then the third, uh, social media, uh, platform that you should get on in terms of content monetization is Meta. And when I say Meta, I'm talking about both Instagram and Facebook. They do have reals bonuses and then recently just a few months ago they uh launched something called uh content monetization beta on Facebook. So this is very similar to uh the create creator rewards program on Tik Tok and also YouTube partner program on YouTube. Uh it is where you create content and then you get rewarded for creating it on the platform. So, in order for you to qualify, uh, you have to get an invitation. Right now, it's invitation only. And I believe it's also limited by countries. And you can get invited if you are living in the United States. So, if you want to see if you qualify, all you have to do is go to Facebook content monetization data on Google and then you'll get something like this and then you can go ahead and sign up for it and then they will audit your account and see if you qualify and then they'll send you an invitation. So once you get accepted into the program, you want to make sure that you have either a professional account or a business uh Facebook page and then once you start creating content, you can get rewarded for it. So the last and final question you need to ask yourself when it comes to deciding what social media platform should you post your content first is the shelf life of the content or the lifespan of your posted content. So platforms like Pinterest or YouTube is more search engine driven meaning uh the content that you posted a year ago, two years ago might still drive traffic to your offers versus content like Tik Tok or Instagram reels and gets you a lot of traction at first but does die down after a couple of months. So think about that too. And this will depend on what your goals are. Are you creating content to drive traffic to your business? Are you creating cont content to be uh monetizing content on the creator platform? Whatever that may be for you, it's going to be according to your unique situation. So, as I mentioned earlier, think about is my target audience on this platform? Should I create content because of that? Does a platform have good content monetization opportunities so that I can get paid to create content on the platform? And then number three, what does the shelf life or the lifespan of my content looks like? Does that mean I have to create a lot more content, or am I looking at my content creation strategy as more of a long-term commitment than a short-term gain? And that's it. Those are my favorite free content creation tools for you to get started as a beginner on a limited budget. If you have any other questions, let me know what those are in the comments below.

While everyone else is busy arguing over who has the best $20 a month chatbot for making a pretty picture, Google just did something insane. They didn't just launch a tool. They quietly [music] released their entire professional-grade AI arsenal. And the whole thing is absolutely free. No, this is not about writing your emails. This is a stack of tools so powerful that researchers are doing a week's worth of work in seconds. This is the new unfair advantage. And while your competition is still stuck in a single chat box, I'm giving you the six tool playbook, the exact workflow. This is the guide Google doesn't want you to see. Let's go. All right, so it's 10 p.m. Your exam is tomorrow. You're staring at five chapters, 30 articles, a 100page PDF of notes, and you are screwed. This is tool number one, notebook LM, and [music] this is your new secret weapon. So, I'm dumping everything in here, all five chapters. my messy class notes, a few web links all at once. Instantly, [music] it reads, indexes, and summarizes everything. But you haven't seen the real magic yet. Google calls it studio. [music] Now, let's be honest. You're tired. Your eyes hurt. You just cannot read another word. So, you don't have to. You just click audio overview and Notebook LM instantly generates a ready to go podcast of all your notes. You can plug in your earphones, go for a walk, and just listen to your chapters. Welcome to the deep dive. [music] Today we're kind of giving you a shortcut taking this really dense stack of advanced chemistry sources. It's your entire notes instantly turned into a bingeworthy AI podcast. [music] Okay, so the audio podcast is great, but what if you're a visual learner? You've listened to the chapter, but it just hasn't clicked. You need to visualize it. Fine, you click video overview, and in about 60 seconds, it generates a short animated explainer video for you. That one chapter you hated, you just got the 7-inute animated summary. This is a total gamecher for complex topics. All right, it's the next morning. It's the day of the exam. You've got 2 hours. You don't have time to relisten or rewatch. You need revision. You [music] click mind map and boom, it generates a complete interconnected map of all five chapters. You can see all the key topics, how they [music] relate and all the sub points. This is your ultimate onepage revision sheet. Okay, final step. It's 1 hour before the exam. You're outside the hall. It's time to improvise. You need to know, are you ready? You click quiz. [music] It instantly generates a practice test based only on your notes. It's testing you on your own material. This is your final check. You find out exactly what you don't know before the professor does. Think about what just happened. You just hacked your exam for free. So, Notebook LM is your exam day hack. [music] But what about your job, your business, your creative hustle? Your problem isn't exams. Your problem is 10 different subscriptions, a tool for writing images, video, email. It's a mess. This is tool number two, [music] Gemini. And no, this is not just a chatbot. This is your new central command. And it starts with the one thing no one else can do. It knows you. I'll just type it. And look, [music] it's connected my Gmail, Drive, and Photos. This is the personalized part. Watch this. Let me give it a prompt. Go into my Gmail, find that presentation the designer sent me last month, pull the three key ideas and go into my Google Drive, find that picture I took of a whiteboard and summarized that too. It just did it. It read my private email, dug through my entire photo library, read my messy handwriting from a photo and gave me a summary. This is not just an AI. This is your personal assistant. Okay, so Gemini is a genius at finding info [music] in your private world, but what about everything else? What about the stuff you don't have? What's happening right now online? This is the deep research feature. You're not just searching Google. You're asking Gemini to read, understand, and analyze the entire live internet and bring you back a report. Okay, so let me just type in the prompt, give me a deep 1,000word analysis on the future of the Indian EV [music] market, citing all your sources and include the latest Q3 2025 financial reports. And there we have our full-blown report. [music] It did the thinking, the analysis, and the citation all by itself. So, it's [music] smart. It's a research intern. But is it creative? Can it actually make things for you? You're building a website for your new side hustle, a small, high-end coffee brand. [music] You don't have a $1,000 budget for a professional photo shoot. Watch this. I have given it a prompt. Create an ultra realistic cinematic 16x9 [music] hero image for a new coffee brand's website. A top- down shot of a black coffee in a minimalist matte black ceramic mug. The mug is on a dark rustic wooden table. Add a few scattered coffee beans and a single small green plant in the soft focus background. The lighting should be [music] soft morning light coming from a window on the left. Look at this. That is not a stock photo. That is the exact custom professional-grade image from my [music] creative brief. So, you've got your perfect product shot. But this is 2025. You need video for your ads, for your social feed. Normally, you'd be back to square one, hiring a videographer, but this is the one. The one that changes everything. Although this comes with a price tag, I have to show you this because this is the tool that lets you fire your video editor, your videographer, and your B-roll subscription [music] all at once. This is Vio, Google's new video generation, and it's built right in. Let's use our coffee shot now. Animate that last image, make Steam gently rise from the coffee mug, and have the camera slowly push in for 5 seconds. 1080p. [music] Make it look cozy and professional. It's done. Here is a 1080p highdefinition usable video clip ready to be used as a social media ad. But now that Gemini has done the creative heavy lifting, we need to think about the building part. This is tool number three, Google AI Studio. [music] And this is your new free custom productivity engine. It's exactly what it sounds like. You don't write code. You just describe the vibe, the goal, and it builds the app for you. Watch this. So here's my prompt. Build me a simple app. It needs one text input, product name, [music] and a second text input, three key features. Then it needs a button that generates five different high energy Gen Z style product descriptions for an Instagram ad. Are you kidding me? Look at that. That's an [music] app. It's a real functional UI with two text boxes and a button. It built the entire tool from my prompt. Now, let's test it. I'll [music] type dark roast smokey bold intense. And I click generate. And it's a real working app. I just built a custom tool for my intern in 60 seconds [music] by just describing an idea. This is a productivity hack. It's not about building some crazy app. It's about building a simple, smart tool that saves you 10 hours a week [music] and gives you the exact data you need to grow your business. That is the real power of AI Studio. It's [music] not just a chatbot. It's a factory that lets you build your own tools without writing a single line of code. And that's not just it. The real magic of AI Studio isn't the text [music] bot. It's multimodality. It's the fact that it can see, hear, and talk. I'm going to show you the pro tip 99% of people miss. This little slider here, temperature, this is your creativity dial. You crank it down to zero. It's a robot. It's 100% facts. No jokes, no risks. You crank it up. It's an artist. It's a brainstormer. It's creative. It takes risks. You are literally controlling the personality of the AI before you even start. Okay, but that is just the start. This is AI Studio [music] Live. This is where it gets eyes and ears. And this is the holy crap moment. This is the most powerful button on the platform. Share screen. This is a live AI companion. Imagine this. You're a designer. You're stuck in Figma. You're looking at a design and it just sucks. Show the share screen view and click talk. Hey studio, look at my screen. This website design is boring. Tell me verbally three specific things I can do right now to fix [music] it. That is the real power of AI Studio. It's not just a chatbot. It's a collaborator. It has a creativity dial. It can generate realistic audio and it can literally look over your shoulder and tell you how to do your job better. So, AI Studio is a monster. It builds custom tools in seconds. But let's be 100% honest. This is ugly. It's functional, but it's ugly. You can't put this on your website. That's where tool number four, Stitch, [music] comes in. It's a prompt to a UI design generator. Let's build a UI for that exact ad copy generator we just made. [music] Watch. Here's the prompt. I need a UI for an ad copy tool. Give me a cozy minimalist vibe for a coffee brand. I need one text input for product name, a second for key features, and a generate [music] button. Show the five results in clean cards below. Okay, that is beautiful. It's a full responsive UI. It understood the cozy vibe. It built the input boxes, the button, the five cards. It just did a designer's entire job in 5 seconds. Now, it's not going to replace a $50,000 design agency, but for your V1, for your side hustle, this is it. But this is the part no one is talking about. This is the workflow. We're taking this real professional-grade code. And now we go back back to our ugly engine and we take all that beautiful UI code and [music] we paste it in. We just transformed our app. We took the brain from AI Studio and gave it the face from Stitch. This is the real zero coder stack. Build the logic in studio. Build the UI and stitch. Combine them and you have a world-class product that you built in 10 minutes. Okay, so you're a builder. You've got your product. You've got your website. You've done the hard part. But now you have to sell it. And this is the part that usually costs a fortune. This is where you hire an agency or a freelancer or just burn out trying to guess what to post. Welcome to tool number five, Pomelli. It's deceptively simple. It's just one box. But this one box is about to replace an entire marketing agency. In that one simple box, you paste a URL. It could be any website. Let's use the coffee shop website we built. So, here's what it does. I'm pasting in the URL of our website. I'm not giving it any other information. Now, watch this. Look at that. It just scanned the website and built a complete brand DNA profile. It knows my colors. It knows my fonts. It knows my cozy tone of voice. It understands the brand from a single link. And now we put it to work by giving it this prompt. Generate a oneweek social media campaign for a fall special latte. [music] I need three Instagram posts and three exposts. Keep the tone cozy and friendly. [music] It's done. We have our images using the right brand colors and the captions using the right tone of voice. It just generated an entire week of professional onbrand marketing content in one [music] click. That is an entire marketing agency in a box for free. We've gone from research to creative to building to design to marketing. That's the five tools stack. And [music] that is already an insane free workflow. But back in the intro, I promised you five tools and one secret wild card. This is tool number six. Opel. AI studio builds complex apps. Stitch builds websites. Pomelly builds marketing. Opel builds other AI tools. This is the no code builder for other no code builders. This is how you make your own AI mini apps in 30 seconds just by describing them. We all have that one annoying task. For [music] me, it's getting a super long formal confusing email from some random companies I don't even know. So instead of wasting time in reading all of that, what I will [music] do? I'm not going to ask AI to help me. I'm going to build a tool that helps me. Watch. I'll give it a prompt. I need a tool. It needs one big text box for a formal email. And it needs two [music] buttons. Button one, translate to simple English. Button two, draft a polite no thank you reply. And you see, it just built the app. It mapped the logic. It understood that two buttons meant two separate jobs. But this is just the blueprint. Now I click publish and [music] it's live. It's a real app. It's a tool I can now bookmark and use every single day. So I paste in the horrible email. I click translate to simple English. Now I click draft a polite no thank you reply. Done. That's it. Think about what just happened. You didn't just use AI. You [music] built an AI tool that's customuilt for your life by just describing it. You could build a tweet idea generator, a réumé helper, a meal planner. [music] This is the zero coder dream. And this is the unfair advantage I promised you. And that [music] is the secret stack. This is what's happening right now for free while everyone else is still arguing over a $20 chatbot. Google didn't just give you a tool. They gave you the entire factory. a research brain, a creative studio, a video editor, an app builder, a web designer, a marketing team, and a tool builder to make your own. You no longer have an excuse. The tools are here. They are free, and 99% of the world has no idea they exist. But now you do. Your unfair advantage starts today. I've put links to all six of these tools down in the description. Go get them and go build something. Thanks for watching. See you in the next one."

And if you've been here lately, you've definitely seen videos like this taking over your feed in the past few weeks. Just take a look at this creator right here. With only 10 videos, he was able to get his channel monetized, grow to over 200,000 subscribers, and consistently pull in well over a million views per upload. Then there's another creator in the same niche who with only five videos has managed to grow to over 200,000 subscribers and reach close to 20 million views. But it doesn't stop there. This third creator posted just two videos, got monetized early on, and started earning revenue in their very first month, which is quite impressive. But here's the thing. Most people think these videos are hard to create. And a few months ago, that was definitely the case. You'd need to hire skilled editors, invest in expensive equipment, and spend countless hours learning the entire process. But let's be real, on this channel, we're all about simpler, smarter methods. That's why in this video, I'm going to give you the complete blueprint to make videos like these using AI to handle all of the heavy lifting for you. And that's just the beginning. I'll show you how to build a perfectly branded channel for this niche, reveal a key step to avoid the dreaded zero views trap when launching a new channel, and teach you how to fully SEO optimize everything so your video has the maximum chance to grow. And trust me, that's only the tip of the iceberg because what you're about to learn in this video will genuinely blow your mind. Now, the first step to creating a successful faceless channel is finding a niche that isn't oversaturated. And since we've already chosen the perfect niche, let me show you some proof that it actually works. Just as an example, Fern is one of the biggest channels in this niche, which has gained a lot of traction over the past few months. And basically, I found this niche using a tool called Nexv, which is optional, but I'm using it because it's really effective. Now, if we open the niche finder feature, you'll see Fern is currently ranked among the top four channels on YouTube. And if we check out the full list, there are plenty of other channels posting faceless videos that can inspire you. But for now, let's stay focused on the niche we've chosen. First, as you can see, this channel is fully monetized. And if we check the channel analytics, we can see it's earning an estimated $50,000 per month from AdSense alone. It's also pulling in around 18 million views monthly. And the RPM for this channel is about $3, which might seem modest, but considering the high volume of views, it's pretty solid. Now, here's the important part. If we use the similar channels feature and click on search, you'll notice several high earning channels in this niche along with many smaller upand cominging channels. This pattern shows us that the niche is active and expanding, making it an ideal time to jump in and start a faceless channel. Also, one thing you might notice about these successful channels is their strong and consistent channel branding. So, now let me show you how to create a perfectly branded channel along with a few other powerful strategies that will help you stand out and grow much faster. For this step, we'll use Chat GPT since it's been recently updated and now delivers some really impressive results. So, start by asking it to generate a list of 10 channel name ideas styled similarly to popular names like Fern, Atrium, and Cipher. And to get the best results, make sure to copy the exact prompt I'm using. You can find all my prompts in my free Telegram channel linked below. Once you use this exact prompt, ChatGpt will give you 10 channel name ideas that are spot-on. They're short, clear, and really memorable. Exactly what we want. Next, with that list in hand, ask ChatGpt to create an SEO optimized channel description. Here, pick the name you like the most. Then, copy and paste it into the prompt so ChatGpt knows which name you chose. After that, just copy the rest of the prompt I'm using and use it to generate your channel description. Now, this process is pretty fast, and as a result, you'll get a description that's SEO optimized, hooking, and genuinely humane. Once you've created the name and description, head over to YouTube Studio and create your channel. Basically, enter your channel name, pick a unique channel handle, and then add the description you just made. With all that set, you're still missing a channel logo. So, let me show you how to create one that will really impress you. To start off, head back into the same chat and chat GPT and start by asking it to create a textto image prompt that you will use to create your channel logo. Also, make sure to enter your channel name in the prompt so ChatGpt knows exactly which name you are using. Then simply copy the rest of the prompt that I'm using and finally click generate. Once the generation process is complete, as you can see, chat GPT will provide you with a custom text to image prompt specifically made for your brand. So first, make sure to copy it from here and then head over into a tool called Leonardo AI. Once you're in, open the text to image feature and watch closely. First, set the generation model to Leonardo Phoenix since it's one of the best for logo creation. Then right below that, set the aspect ratio to one by one because that's the standard logo format. Once that's done, paste your custom logo prompt into the prompt box and then click generate. The process usually takes around 20 seconds. And when it's complete, as you can see, we've just created four channel logo examples that are absolutely perfect. They match our brand. They're minimalistic and highquality, which is exactly what we need. So now, simply choose the one you like the most and download it by clicking the download button above it. Next, head back into YouTube Studio. Upload your new logo. Adjust it if needed. And if everything looks good, simply click the done button below. Now that your channel logo is all set, you're still missing a channel banner. So, let's create one quickly that will match our brand perfectly. Now, to create our channel banner, we'll use Canva, so go ahead and open it. Once you're in, head over to the templates menu. Then, select the YouTube banner templates. Here, you'll find hundreds of free templates you can use, and many of them are already pretty solid. Now, pick the one you like best, open it, and click on the customize template button. Now, as you can see here, we can edit the entire template however we like. Basically, no matter which template you choose, the process is the same. So, follow along. For this one, since I want it to be minimalistic, I'll place the channel name in the center. And just below it, I'll add a small line saying that videos are uploaded almost every week, just as a light-hearted touch. Then, I'll remove all of the other unnecessary text we don't need. And that's pretty much it. This process is super easy. And with that, our channel banner is ready. Now, to download it, click the download button at the top and use the exact same settings that I'm using to get the best result. Now that we've created the channel banner, head back into YouTube Studio and upload it. Adjust the positioning if needed. And once everything looks good, click done. Finally, hit the publish button at the top to save everything. And with that, your channel is almost ready. Now, let me show you how to maximize the visibility of your channel. A powerful step that very few people talk about. To start, click on the settings button below. Then open the channel settings. Inside, you'll find a keyword section, which is crucial for improving your channel's visibility. So, let me show you exactly how to create the perfect set of keywords. For this step, we'll use a free tool called Vid IQ. So, go ahead and open it. Once you're in, first open the AI Coach menu on the left side. This is basically an AI assistant specifically designed for SEO optimization. Start by asking it to create a list of optimized channel tags. Make sure to enter your channel name right next to that request so the coach knows exactly what you're working with. Then simply explain what your channel is about. Or if you want the best results, copy the exact prompt I'm using right here. Once that's ready, click the generate button and the optimization process will begin. Now, as you can see, the AI coach will start digging into real-time information. As a result, it will give you the most recent trending channel tags. You can even connect your channel to this tool, and it will tailor the results specifically to your channel. Once the process is done, just like that, we've created a list of the most SEO optimized video tags for 2025 made exactly for our channel. Now, simply copy the list from here. Head back into the YouTube studio and paste the tags into the channel keyword section. Before we finally move on, there's one more important step that can really boost your channel's visibility. If you open the feature eligibility settings, you'll see an option to confirm your phone number. This step is a must because it gives YouTube a clear signal that your channel is authentic and not just lowquality spam. And here's a pro tip. If your new channel feels stuck with zero views, one way to help is to spend about a week actively using YouTube before uploading your first video. Watch content like videos and interact naturally. This helps warm up your account so it's ready for better engagement once you start posting. All right, now that we've created a perfectly branded channel, it's time to jump into the video creation process. The very first thing we need to do is prepare all of the prompts that will guide the creation of our video. This step is important, so watch closely. First, open a successful channel in the same niche that has proven results. For example, this one. Next, copy the first three rows right here. And once that's done, head over to Chat GPT. Paste everything you've copied into the chat. And at the end, simply ask it to export only the video titles. Once that's done, ChatGpt now has a clear idea of what works well and we have a clean list of examples we can use for inspiration. So, now that we have a list of topics that actually work, let me show you how to use those topics to create original ideas that are proven to perform well. To start, ask ChatGpt to identify common themes, narrative structures, and emotional triggers based on the titles you gathered. Then, ask it to generate new topics grounded in those insights. Since this prompt is a bit long, you can either copy it directly from here or grab it from my free Telegram channel linked below. And once you use this prompt, chat GPT will provide you with a list of original video topics that have the potential to go viral. All based on concepts that have been tested and proven. Now that we have created the video topics, let's move on to the next step, which is using them to create your own highly engaging and original script. To do this, in the same chat in chat GPT, ask it to write a complete script for a viral YouTube documentary video in a style similar to Fern. Then, browse through the topics it generates and pick the one you like the most. Paste that topic back into the prompt so ChatGpt knows exactly which one you've chosen. Finally, make sure to specify the desired video length. In this example, I'll set it to 2 minutes to keep things simple, but feel free to request longer scripts, anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes if you want a more detailed video. Okay, once everything is set, simply click generate to start the process. When it's done, ChatGpt will provide you with an original, highly engaging script based on your chosen topic. This script will be created in a viral documentary style, similar to what many popular creators use. And trust me, this is one of the best ways to craft a script that is both engaging and unique. So, now that we have created our own original script, it's time to create image prompts that we will use to create the images for our video. To do that, in the same chat, ask chat GPT to generate image prompts that perfectly represent the script above. Then, make sure to tell it that you want them to be in a 3D animation style, which is super important. Also, make sure to tell it that each image will last around 3 to 5 seconds in the video, so it gives you more image prompts that you can use. Now, since this prompt is a bit complicated, make sure to copy the entire prompt that I'm using right here to get the best results. Once that's done, finally, click generate, and the generation process will start. This process might take up to 30 seconds since the results are a bit more detailed. And once it's done, as you can see, ChatGpt has provided us with 15 image prompts that perfectly represent the script and are made in the 3D animation style. Now, watch closely. Since we want to have more visuals in our video so it will be more engaging, if you are not happy with the 15 scenes that you have created, make sure to ask ChatGpt to expand the list to around 25 image prompts. And just like that, it will give you an expanded list of 25 image prompts, which should be more than enough for a video that is roughly 2 minutes. In the same way, you can create endless prompts that you can use. So, you can easily create a video that is more than 15 minutes long. All right. Now that we have created a list of 25 image prompts, the next thing we need to do is create 25 animation prompts that we will use to animate our images using an image to video feature. To do that, ask chat GPT to create a list of detailed animation prompts that are based on the script and the image prompts above. Now, this prompt is also very detailed. So, for the best result, make sure to copy the entire prompt that I'm using. Now, once you click generate, the generation process will start, which might take a bit longer since the prompts are detailed. And once it's done, as you can see, chat GPT has provided us with a list of 25 animation prompts that perfectly match the visual prompts that we have created before. And it was very easy to create them. Now, the final step before we start with the video creation process is to create sound effect prompts that we will use to add sound effects to the scenes that we will create. To do that, in the same chat, ask chat GPT to create a list of sound effect prompts based on everything you have created above. And once again, make sure to copy the exact prompt that I'm using for the best results. Once you use this exact prompt, ChatGpt will provide you with a list of 25 sound effect prompts that you can use to add sound effects to all of the scenes. And with that, you are finally ready to create your first video. So, make sure to save this chat because you will need it soon. Now that we have created prompts for each step that we will be implementing, it's time to finally create the video. And to do that, I found an alternative that has everything in one place. So, you won't have to pay for multiple tools and waste your time. And the tool I'm talking about is called video talk. So, go ahead and open it. Now, once you are in, you will notice three main features that you can use here. We will start by opening the create video from scratch feature. since we are literally starting from zero. To start off, you will find all of the main tools in the menu on the left side. And the first one we will use is the voice over feature, which we'll use to create the voice over for our video. Here, as you can see, the first step is to import your video script. So, head back into chat GPT and copy the entire script that you have created. Then go back into video talk and paste the script into the script section. Once that's done, just below the script, you will find a list of multiple voices that you can use for your voiceover. And although there are some great choices, I will use the Johnny voice since it really matches our video vibe and you'll see why shortly. Now, once you have selected the voice, click on the button below and then click on the add voice button. This process will be pretty fast and once it's done, as you can see, the voice over will be automatically imported into our video timeline. So, now let's see how it sounds like. >> They say the Pentagon is impenetrable layers of steel. >> Just like I told you, the voice is just great and it fits our video perfectly. So now that we have created the voice over, let's head over into the next step where we will create the images for our video. To do that, open the media section on the left side. And here, as you can see, we will need to enter a prompt. So now head over into chat GPT where you have created the image prompts and then copy the first image prompt for the first scene. Then head back into video talk and paste it into the prompt section. Once that's done, open the aspect ratio settings below and make sure to select the 16 to9 ratio. Next, open the model settings on the left side where you will find a list of different models you can use. Basically, here you have a lot of great options, but I will use the Google Imagin 4 Ultra since it's pretty affordable and gives amazing results. Now that everything is set, click on the generate button below and the generation process will start. This process will be pretty fast, usually around 10 seconds. And once it's done, as easy as that, we have just created a perfect image for our first scene. And to be honest, I really like how it came out. So now before we head over into the next step, let's create another image, but this time for our second scene. So now head over into chat GPT and here make sure to copy the image prompt for the second scene. Then head back into video talk and paste it into the prompt section. Once that's done, finally click generate. And the generation process will start. This process will be the same, so I will skip it. And once it's done, as you can see, we have just created another image that looks really good. And the entire process was very easy. Now listen, you need to create all of the images for each scene in the same exact way. And you can even create them in bulk without waiting for each image to finish. So you can save some time. And just to save you some time, as you can see, I have created all of the images in the same way. And they came out perfect. So now that you have created all of the images for your video, you will be ready for the next step where we will take the images and turn them into a full video. Now to start off, simply click on the image for your first scene and the image to video feature will open for you. So now head over into chat GPT where you have created the animation prompts and here start by copying the animation prompt for the first scene. Then head back into video talk and paste it into the prompt section. Next, make sure that the aspect ratio is set as 16x9, same as before, and then open the video model settings. Here you have a variety of models that you can choose from and all of them work great, but I will use the Hiluo Pro model since it gives good results and is fairly affordable. Finally, once everything is ready, click on the generate button below and the generation process will start. Now, this process will take around 1 to 2 minutes depending on the model you are using. And once it's done, as easy as that, our first video will be finally ready. So, let's see how it came out. Just as expected, the video is high quality and the animations are very realistic and stable, which is exactly what we need. So, now that our first video is ready, let's create another one, but this time for our second scene. So, first scroll down and here, make sure to select the image of the second scene that you have created. Then, head over into chat GPT and here, copy the animation prompt for the second scene. Then, head back into video talk and paste it into the prompt box. Once that's done, just make sure you are still using the same model. And if everything looks good, finally click generate. Now this process will be the same, so I will skip it. And once it's done, our second video will be finally ready. So now let's see how it came out. This one came out pretty good as well. It's high quality. The frames are smooth and the animation is on point. So now that I have showed you how to create the videos for each scene, now you will need to do the same for all of the scenes in your video. You can also generate them in bulk, just as before, and then just wait for all of them to finish at once. And just to save some time, I have already created all of the videos in the same exact way. And trust me, this process is very easy. Now, if you open the video menu above here, you will find all of your videos that you have created. And since all of our videos are fully ready, now you are ready for the next step where we will add sound effects to our videos. Now, to start off, open the first video that you have created. And as you can see, the sound effect feature will open for you. So, now head over into chat GPT where you have created the sound effect prompts. And here, copy the first one on the list. Next, head back into video talk and then paste it into the prompt section. Once that's done, finally click generate and the generation process will start. Now, this process will be very fast and once it's done, our video will be ready. So, now let's finally see how the sound effect came out. As you can see, the sound effect matches the scene perfectly, and it was very easy to implement. So, now that you know how to add sound effects to your videos, you have a few choices here. First, you can add sound effects to all of your videos in the same exact way and then create the full video. Then, you can even use the sound effects feature on the left side, which will allow you to use pre-made sound effects from the list or even upload your own if you like. In my case, I will make a hybrid video using both pre-made effects and also full sound effects like we have added just now. So, now that everything is ready, let's start with the video editing process. To start off, first select the voice over and then drag it only one line below in the timeline so that you will have a free slot to import your videos here. Once that's done, let's start with the first video. Select the video for the first scene and simply drag it above the voice over in the timeline. Then make sure it's set right at the beginning of the timeline and go through the voice over to cut the video so that it matches if needed. Next, open the video section again and this time select the video for the second scene. drag it right next to the first one and do the same. Simply listen to the voice over and cut it if needed. This step is super easy. Simply drag all of the videos into the timeline until you reach the end of the voice over. And just to save some time, as you can see, I've already done this for all of the videos. So, your timeline should look similar to what I have right here. So, now that you've imported all of the videos into the timeline, let me show you a few more features that can make your video even better. First, you can add captions to your video. But since this is a 3D documentary, we won't need them. Next, you can add transitions between the clips. And there's a list of some very interesting ones, but I won't be using them here since I want clean cuts between each scene. Then, you can also add text to certain scenes to make the video look nicer. This is optional, so feel free to experiment with it on your own. Now, just so you don't get confused, let me explain how to add additional sound effects to your video. To start off, open the sound effects menu on the left side where you'll find a list of pre-made options. To add one, simply choose the sound effect you like and click on it, and it will automatically be added to your timeline. From there, you can move it wherever you want it to be. That's pretty much it. This step is simple, so we won't spend much time on it. So, now that everything is ready, let's add the final touch to the video, which is the background music. To do that, open the music menu on the left side, where you'll find a list of background tracks that are completely free to use. here. Just choose the one you like most. Click on it and it will automatically be added to your timeline. Then lower the volume to around minus20 so it doesn't overpower your voice over. And with that, your video will be ready to be exported. Now to export the video, simply click on export video at the top. Once it's done, your video will be fully exported. So now let's see how the video came out. They say the Pentagon is impenetrable. layers of steel, security clearances, and firewalls stretching into infinity. The heart of America's defense, guarded by some of the most advanced technology in the world. But in the spring of 1990, that fortress was breached, not by a foreign spy or a rogue military officer, but by a boy. Jonathan James was just 15, too young to drive, barely old enough to understand the weight of what he was doing. Sitting in a bedroom in Miami, surrounded by empty soda cans and the hum of an old computer tower, he found a way in. It started small, a curiosity about how things worked, and a belief that if someone built a wall, there must be a way to climb it. One late night, his screen filled with lines of green code. each keystroke a step deeper into the Pentagon's network. By the time anyone noticed, he'd accessed thousands of internal messages. He'd seen realworld military operations and even intercepted passwords from NASA computers. The kind of information that in the wrong hands could change the course of nations. When federal agents arrived at his door, the world finally met the boy behind the breach. He was calm, polite, almost shy. To him, it hadn't been an act of war. It had been a challenge. Jonathan was arrested, becoming the youngest person ever convicted of a cyber crime in the United States. The story doesn't end there. Years later, his name surfaced in another investigation, one he swore he had nothing to do with. Facing the weight of a system he no longer believed in, Jonathan took his own life at the age of 24. And so the boy who once slipped past the most secure defenses in the world was undone by the ones inside his own mind. We like to think firewalls can keep the danger out, but sometimes the most vulnerable systems aren't built of code and steel. They're made of flesh and blood. This video is simply a masterpiece. It's high quality, has an incredible storyline, and the animations are spot-on. and you can see for yourself that the video we've created has huge potential to reach a wide audience. So, now that you have created the video, let me show you how to correctly upload it to YouTube to maximize its visibility. To start off, open YouTube Studio and upload the video you've just created. Once it's uploaded, you'll notice we're still missing all the important details. So, first let's start with the video title. Now, if you remember, we already prepared one earlier. So, head back to chat GPT where you created the video script. Then, copy the title you chose from here. Then return to YouTube Studio and paste it into the title field. Now, since the video is processing and it might take a bit of time, let me show you how to create a thumbnail that will really stand out. And trust me, the results will be really impressive. To start off, open a new chat in Chat GPT and watch closely here. You'll need to tell Chat GPT that you want it to act as an expert thumbnail designer and create a text to image prompt that you will use to make a thumbnail in a 3D render style. Then, below that, make sure to enter your video title so it knows the topic of your video. After that, I've included some instruction prompts. So, for the best results, make sure to copy the entire prompt that I'm using and you'll be good to go. Once the generation process is done, ChatGpt will provide you with a prompt that is specifically made for your video title. And in the end, it will give you a 3D render style thumbnail. Now, once you have a full prompt ready, make sure to copy it from here and then head over into Leonardo AI. First, make sure to select Leonardo Phoenix as the generation model. And below that, set the aspect ratio to 16x9 since that's the YouTube thumbnail format. Next, simply paste the prompt into the prompt section. And finally, click generate. This process might take around 20 seconds. And once it's done, as you can see, we have just created some perfect thumbnail samples that we can use for our video. If you don't like how the first batch came out, you can simply generate a few more batches in the same way. Once it's done, as easy as that, you will have more choices to pick from. Now, go through them. Find the one you like the most and once you do, just download it by clicking the download button right here. Now that you have downloaded the thumbnail, head back into YouTube Studio and upload it in the thumbnail section. Once you do, it should look something like I have right here. Now that the thumbnail is set, you're still missing an SEO optimized description and tags, which are super important. So, let me show you how it's done. For this step, we will use Vid IQ, the same tool we used before. Once you're in, start by opening the AI Coach feature and watch closely. Here you will need to tell the coach that you wanted to act as an expert in YouTube SEO optimization. Next, enter your video title so it knows your video topic. Below that, I have entered some instructions on how everything needs to be done. So, make sure to copy the entire prompt I'm using and you'll be good to go. Once the process is complete, as you can see, we've created a SEO optimized description that is engaging, has a strong hook at the beginning, and includes optimized hashtags at the end, which is really important. Below that, it also provides a list of viral video tags that we can use, which are equally crucial for maximizing visibility. So, now that everything is ready, start by copying the video description from here. And then head back into YouTube Studio and paste it into the description section. Next, scroll down and in the made for kids section, set the answer to no. Then, scroll down even further and in the altered content section, set the answer to yes. Now, if you scroll down a bit more, you will find the video tags section. So, first head over into Vid IQ and copy the tags that you created. Then go back into YouTube Studio and paste them into the tag section. And just like that, your video is finally ready. Now, if we head over into the video check section, you can see that our video is fully monetizable and it doesn't have any copyright material in it. So now, let's finally post it. To do that, head over into the visibility section, then set the video to public, and then finally click publish. And congrats, you have just published your first YouTube video that has a real potential to go viral. Now that I've shown you the entire blueprint, you are finally ready to start your own faceless channel. And let me tell you, making money with a faceless channel isn't as hard as you think. But it does take a lot of work and consistency to really make it happen. And if this video has helped you out, make sure to hit the like button and leave a comment. And as always, keep pushing and I'll see you in the next"

🎬 Perfect YouTube Script Formula video: https://youtu.be/h8HlzJFJ-3k?si=0QN9Ca9pJRJ4xxGO

👉Prompt 1:
""I want you to help me come up with YouTube topics and titles that are perfectly aligned with what I charge money for — but also based on what people are actually searching for on YouTube.

Here’s what I need you to balance for me:

The topics must directly connect to my services or the problems I solve for clients.

The keyword phrases need to come from real YouTube searches with enough volume to be worth targeting.

The finished titles should use those same keyword phrases but add a bit of curiosity or emotional pull that makes people want to click.

My business: [describe what you sell]

My ideal clients: [describe who they are]

What I help them with: [list the main services or problems you solve]

Now, go to YouTube and find the best keyword phrases related to this business and audience. Make sure they have real search intent and aren’t too broad.

Give me the results in two columns:

Column A: The actual keyword phrase people search for

Column B: A strong, clickable YouTube title that includes that phrase and adds some intrigue

Only include ideas that could realistically help a new channel build authority in this niche. You can give me as many ideas as I ask for (for example, 10 or 52 if I want a year’s worth).

Everything should be based on real research, not guesses.""

👉Prompt 2:
“I’m planning a full video about [FILL IN THE BLANK] I already know I want to include the following: [BRAIN DUMP EVERYTHING HERE]

Because the truth is, most business owners are stuck spending a few days out of their week on one single video, researching topics, writing scripts, designing thumbnails, editing for hours. But AI can actually handle about 80% of that work better than you could doing it manually. And I'm not even talking about using chat GBT to spit out soulless scripts or Sora to make those AI slop videos that no one wants to watch. I'm talking about five specific AI workflows that the biggest YouTubers are quietly using to finish highquality business building videos in two or three hours instead of days. In this video, I'll show you these exact five AI workflows that take you from a blank screen to finished video in just a few hours that actually keeps people watching longer than if you'd done everything manually. And we're going to go in the same order that you would go if you're planning and making a video. So, some of the coolest workflows are going to be a little more toward the end. And honestly, the last one is by far the most fun and it's going to put your videos way ahead of what your competition's doing. The biggest thing my students in my YouTube clients academy program used to struggle with was coming up with the right topics and titles for their videos. They needed topics that aligned really closely with what they charge money for, but also had the right search terms that people were actively looking for with enough search volume to make it worth it. Plus, the titles needed to have that X factor that made people want to actually click through to watch. So, I saw them all fumbling with this at first, and they were making videos that never really stood a chance at finding the right audience. So, I tried coming up with prompt after prompt to help them nail all of it in one go. But, it was so many factors to keep track of, nothing really did it until the day that Chat GBT released agent mode. The very first basic attempt I tried at that, it wasn't perfect, but it told me this was going to be the magic bullet for balancing everything out. So, my team and I worked on that prompt for literally two weeks straight, and we've done a lot of tweaking to it since, actually. We finally got to the one that works perfectly every time. And that one's very long and complex. So, today I'm just going to share a simpler version of it. But if you did want the whole thing, it is included in my program. You can learn more about that in the link in the description. But the important thing is just to be super clear with chat GBT about what you need it to balance out for you. So, it needs to find the topics and titles that a new channel could talk about to build their authority in your overall niche using the right keyword phrases that people actually search for in YouTube and to provide you with however many options you want. So, you can even ask for your entire year's worth of topics that way. Tell it to go right to the source, YouTube itself, to see what people are typing into the search bar. And of course, you're going to need to prime it by telling it as much about your business and your ideal clients as possible. It needs to know at a bare minimum, like what services you provide, the problems you solve, all that stuff. And here's the important part. You need to make sure that it's set on agent mode. Normal deep research will not be able to, you know, open up YouTube and literally start typing things into the search bar to get the clues it needs. That's the secret sauce to this working at all. Then you want to ask for two columns. Column A being the topic that's based on a real keyword phrase and then column B being the finished title that uses that keyword phrase plus, you know, add some extra heat to it that makes it actually sound intriguing. And what it gives you back here should be miles ahead of what you may spend hours, you know, strategizing manually because it's actually based on research, not just on your best guesses of what people might be searching for. Okay, so that takes care of your content ideas and your titles, but every good YouTube expert agrees that next to the title, your thumbnail is the most important part of setting your video up to get lots of views. So important, in fact, that the thumbnail and the title should actually be figured out before you even start making the video. The idea being, if you can't figure out a good enough way to package the idea, you might as well just move on to the next one. The thing is thumbnails are so tricky because they need some strategy like how will I visually show this idea and actual design skills using Photoshop or Canva. And most people aren't good designers. I mean, heck, most designers aren't good designers. So, what are you supposed to do? Well, AI gives us some really easy ways to create winning thumbnail concepts and designs. So, you may have heard of Google's new AI image generator. they're calling Nano Banana and it's pretty solid. You can give it a photo of yourself and tell it roughly what you want. Sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't. You know, sometimes it looks just like you, sometimes it looks more like this. And it definitely still struggles with making the image the right thumbnail dimensions. So, this actually is not the AI tool that I'm going to recommend the most here. Instead, check out this one called Pixels. Now, this does a much better job at nailing your likeness because it actually has you upload up to 20 photos of yourself. That's just way more data that lets it properly train itself on what your face looks like. So, you can make your AI twin basically do anything you want in a thumbnail. Now, this works best if you give it a, you know, good variety of expressions and facial angles so that it really gets to know your face. Now, from there, you've got some choices. You can just do a simple text prompt telling it what you want to be in the thumbnail. And you can even include text in the thumbnail. It does really well with text. And unlike Nano Banana, all it does is thumbnails, so it knows what they're supposed to look like specifically. Maybe it'll nail it on the first try, but if not, you can at least call what it gives you a good first draft and ask for changes or just start over if you want. It only takes it about, you know, a minute to make each one of these. But probably the coolest option in pixels is the recreate feature where you find an existing thumbnail on YouTube. You paste in the link and just tell it, you know, I want this, but change that to make it fit the needs of your video and to differentiate it from the original. Like maybe you're a life coach and you want to make a video about the best meditation apps and you want to take this thumbnail concept by Jeff Sue, but instead of showing the time and chat GBT alert on the phone, you want it to look like a meditation app. And maybe you wanted to show your face looking calm. Just ask for those changes and boom. So the big ugly question is, is this stealing? Well, not as much as you might think. So, YouTube experts like Patty Galloway fully endorse what they call ethically stealing, taking proven thumbnail concepts and making them your own. The logic is, you know, thumbnails are marketing tools, not art pieces. So, if a layout or expression or hook is already proven to get clicks, reusing that idea with your own face, branding, and text is simply applying databack design. It's not really plagiarism. Because the thing is, there's no copyright on a style or on a general concept. And reinventing the wheel just wastes extra time while also lowering your odds of it working. By just taking and lightly tweaking what already works, you can shortcut your way to more clicks while still creating original content. The way I and a lot of other YouTube experts see it, copying concepts isn't theft. It's just a smart growth strategy. Pretty much all the big players on YouTube are already doing it, myself included. I've definitely taken some proven concepts and others have definitely taken for me. Just think of it as the circle of life, but for video marketing. And in the end, your thumbnail is probably going to look really different from the original anyway because it's you, your colors, possibly different objects, different text, everything. And it also just makes changes on its own anyway. All right. So, you've got your title and thumbnail locked in. Now, it's time for the script. But here's the thing. you probably already know about 70% of what you want to say. It's that other 30% that kills you, right? The stats that you can't quite remember, uh the example that would perfectly prove your point, the three extra tips that would make your video just super complete instead of just okay. So, for this, let's go back to chat GPT, but this time we're going to turn on deep research mode. So, you'll just tell it the title and a general description of the video itself along with all the stuff that you know you want to talk about in the video. Just go ahead and brain dump it all out there. It doesn't have to be structured or organized in any special way. JGBT's superpower is taking chaos and organizing it for you. So, just tell it you wanted to do enough research to fill in the gaps and then ask it for anything that you want specifically, whether it's a few more tips or to help you make an argument or state an opinion. I personally love asking it to help me out with finding real world case studies or you know stats that I can use to help me make my points. And I always have to tell it not to take irrelevant side quests or tangents because if you don't say that it does have a tendency to like over research and turn a tight focused topic into a crazy unwieldy video that should really be more like five separate ones. Then it'll always ask you a few follow-ups just to get on the right track. But once it gets going, it's going to take some time, maybe up to 15 minutes or so, getting it all researched for you. Then what you get back is a great basic structure for our next workflow. Scripting. It's probably no surprise that AI can handle this part of the process, but and I have to stress this, most people do this completely wrong and end up with a really bad script because they didn't prime the system for a good one. So, I've come up with a pretty cool AI process. And this particular workflow is designed to not just get a script written, but to create your reusable script writing agent that you can go back to every time to nail every single script you ever need. All that involves is creating your own custom GPT in chat GBT or a project in Claude. The tool you use is up to you. I do think Claude is still a little bit better at writing like a human than Chat GBT is, but if you already pay for ChatGpt and you don't want to pay for another tool, it still does a great job. So, I'm just going to show you the rough workflow in ChatGpt. But if you were to do it in Claude, it's pretty much the exact same process. All you need to get started here is a good scripting formula. And I do have a video all about the perfect YouTube script formula for client generation videos. You can click the link in the description for that. And you also need a good writing sample that you want the AI to, you know, mimic when writing so it sounds like you rather than its default tone, which is usually just a dead giveaway that it's AI, not you. Now, you can make your scripting agent even better if you had more examples of things like, you know, great opening hooks or a good solid document about you and your experiences, stories of you working with clients, stuff like that that it can draw from. But for now, let's just do this with the bare minimum two documents. Uh the first one laying out the perfect script formula and the other being your writing sample. That can either be something you've written yourself or better yet a transcript from you just talking naturally because scripting tends to work best if it's written like how you talk. But if you don't have one of those or if you can find an existing YouTuber who speaks the way that you would like to speak in your videos, go ahead and grab about 10 minutes worth of transcripts of them, you know, just talking and then put that in a document. Then when you've got all that together, go to chat GPT and under GPTs, click explore, then create or if you're using Claude, click projects, then new project. Then you just need to name your agent and then give it its instructions. I'm not going to read through the whole thing. It's kind of long, but just know you can uh copy and paste it from the description below. And uh you should probably just kind of take a look at it to see what this is doing. Then just upload your training materials. And that's it. Now, every time you need a script, you just open up your agent and kick off the process by pasting in all your research and your rough ideas. Then it's going to give you a solid 85% first draft. You just have to add the last 15%. Okay, now for the really fun workflow I promised you earlier. This one isn't just practical and time-saving. It's actually going to put your videos way ahead of what your competition's doing, making them more engaging and watchable. And that's important cuz the the more people like and watch your videos, the more YouTube's going to show them to more people. So, you can actually really work the algorithm in your favor here. And look, it's totally fine to go simple on your videos, especially when you're teaching something. But sometimes it helps to add some really simple visuals that keep people interested and help you tell your story better. And one of the best ways to do this is with B-roll video. That's just what we call videos like this, this, or this that play over you talking. It just helps you tell a story visually and lets you show something rather than just tell it. And sure, it's always been easy to just buy stock clips. You know, they cost about five bucks, but they're not special. They look exactly like what they are. Generic stock footage everyone else is using for five bucks. But what if you could create something that looks and feels custom starring you? Maybe you're working with a client. Maybe you're speaking from a stage. Maybe anything else you can imagine. With the new Sora 2, this kind of footage that features, you know, a virtual you has never been easier to make or more convincing. And that just opens up the scope of your videos in ways that weren't possible before. And yeah, AI videos everywhere now. Your feed's probably full of those faceless channels just pumping out garbage. But that's not what we're doing here. We're going to be using it to enhance videos that are already good, not replace the human element. To get started, just open up the Sora app, and you're going to use the Cameo feature to train the AI in your face by following some simple instructions. Once you've done that, you can ask it for pretty much anything, including actual spoken dialogue if you want. Now, I can't tell you how impressed I am by this. When I did it in the first couple days of its release, all it asked me to do was say three numbers and turn my head. And then the output was shockingly accurate. And I'm betting they'll add away in time to have you talk longer to make it even more accurate. But even right now, the non-speaking B-roll that it's made of me is really good and 100% ready to use. And you can also use this for motion graphics. Just tell it the style you like or give it a reference image and then tell it what you want to happen. So, I just asked for a futuristic purple and black gradient background with four glowing futuristic icons and it gave me this in just a few minutes and this would have taken my editor a few hours to do. But getting people to watch your videos is one thing. Getting them to pull out their credit card and hire you, that's completely different. So, I want to invite you to my free master class where I'm going to show you my five secrets to building the client attraction YouTube channel that you know you need in 2026. This is the system that actually turns viewers into buyers on autopilot. You'll use these AI workflows to get everything done in just a few hours per week. But more importantly, you'll know exactly what to create that gets people to reach out ready to work with you. So, click right here and sign up for free. I'm gonna send you the training right now. So, click here and I'll see you right"

#AIAudio #ElevenLabs",AI workflow for content creation,86336,4164,100,2025-10,"You're going to learn how to create cinematic 3D AI B-roll to take your YouTube videos, documentaries, and storytelling content to the next level. We're going to go through the entire video creation process to turn that AI B-roll into a full scene with ChatGpt, Vio 3.1, and 11 apps. And this custom B-roll style is used in the content production by some of the top YouTube creators, which get millions of views. We're going to recreate the same quality B-roll using AI. So, the very first step is to head to this GPT, which is going to help you turn either prompts or images into the 3D cinematic scenes that you're looking for. And the link to this GPT is going to be in the description down below. Now, if you didn't want to use this specific GPT or you wanted to use another LLM, I'm going to put the prompt on screen right now. And all you have to do is to replace the criteria within the square brackets. And you could just actually ask an LLM to do this for you based on an image. But essentially, this custom GPT right here does all of this for you automatically. And a couple of extra things, too. So, the very first step is to go ahead and upload a file. And here, I'm simply going to choose an image from my computer. And now you can be pretty flexible with the actual image you upload because we're going to create it in the exact cinematic 3D style we want in the aspect ratio we like. So I'm just going to upload this image right here of me talking to a crowd. And then I simply click open. And now all I'm going to do is actually click send here. The GPT then gives us the main scene prompt which describes what it sees in the image and then also the B-roll prompts. So we've got a few different choices as to what kind of angle we want. Now, at the end, we're then asked which image we would like to generate. So, we can either choose the main scene or we can have the B-roll 1 2 or three. And so, this actually allows us to then get different shots and different angles within the same location of the same character. Now, here I want to generate the main scene prompt. So, let's just do main scene because I want it to look very similar to the original image. I'm just going to type out main scene. Now, we're asked what aspect ratio we want for our content. And so, here I want to do this for YouTube. So, I'm simply going to type one, or you could just type YouTube. And now we're going to get a 16x9 image generated based off of the original image we gave it and from the custom prompt that I showed you earlier that has been ran through this GPT. And so now, as you can see, the image has been generated. And if we put both of these side by side, you can see that it's actually a very accurate representation of the original image. The character's wearing a cap holding the microphone. We've even got the laptop, which is on the side of the image. The AI even picked that up. And then we've got the brick wall, the curtains, and the plant in the background. Below it, you'll also notice that we're given a video prompt. And this is the video prompt that we're going to use to then bring this AI B-roll image to life. And so, this video prompt has been tailored to this image. And so, we're going to take this prompt, we're going to copy it, and then we're also going to save the image. Then, we're going to head to Google Labs, and we're going to use V3.1. And we're going to go ahead and upload the image that we've just saved from chat GPT. And then, we simply paste in the prompt. And then we click send. And now our image is going to be generated and turned into cinematic AI B-roll. Now, while that's loading, I do want to mention that you can use different AI models to get different results. Not only just with the video, but also at the image level. So, for an example, first of all, for the image here, I could use Clling's latest video 2.5 Turbo model, upload the same image, and then also paste in the prompt. And I've actually been using the DeepSeek feature, which actually rewrites the prompt for you, even more tailored to that image. And sometimes the results are actually really good. So let's go ahead and use one of these prompts and then we'll click generate and compare it with VO3.1. But if we're not happy with the style of the image generated within chat GPT, we can actually go and use plenty of other AI image models to generate different looks because they all give different results with the same prompt. And so here I would go back to the GPT and I would copy the prompt that I wanted to generate. So, for example, let's just take the main scene prompt. And then I can paste it into a tool like Freepick and select one of the image models. And I've been getting some really nice results with Google Imaging 4. And so here I can click generate. And as you can see, the style of the image is completely different even though we didn't use the original image as a reference frame. If we did want to use the original image as a reference frame, we could go ahead and use a model such as Cadream Creree 44K and then upload the image and then click generate. And as you can see, we've got four different images that are generated with the Cream 4K model. However, I prefer the style of Imagining 4 here because it's got this really nice 3D render look. So, if I wanted, I could download this image and then use this as the base image to then turn into B-roll. And when it comes to creating multiple scenes here, we would want to switch to the model flux flux context max. And then here, we drag the image that we like. And then we can go back to GPT and we can use one of the B-roll angle. So here we could do this side angle one. So I would copy this prompt right here. Go back to Flux Context, paste the prompt, and then here we simply click generate. And I'm going to generate two at a time. And now here you'll notice that the two images we've generated have the exact same backdrop. This one's a little bit different, but I want the backdrop to be different. And so I'm simply going to modify the prompt and I'm going to put windows in the background. And as you can see, now we've got more of a side angle. And you can keep on reprompting until you get exactly what you want. But I like this because there's continuity. Right here, we can see the side of the whiteboard or just the edge. And then at the top here, we can actually see more of the the whiteboard. And so it looks like we're in completely the same environment just from a different angle. So I'm also going to download this one. And now let's head back and see what the original videos looked like. >> Understanding the data is only the first step. The true challenge lies in its application to the human element. >> And so this actually looks really good. It's very slow movement. It's kept the overall style and aesthetic of the 3D render throughout the entire video. Ignore the audio because we're going to use our own in 11 Labs. And so, as you can see, both of them have succeeded in keeping that realistic 3D render look throughout the entire video. And they both got slow and static movement. So, which one you use is really just a question of preference. And now, both of these were generated with audio, but it's not audio we're going to use because we're going to be using 11 Labs. And now for the scene that I'm going to create, we're going to use the two images that were made using Imagin 4 and Flux Context. I run both of those through VO3.1 with the same video prompt that we got from chat GPT. And once I have all of my cinematic 3D AI B-roll generated with V3.1, I can then pull everything into 11 Labs so we can create the voice over and also add some music and potentially some sound effects to create the entire final video. So in 11 Labs, we're simply going to click on studio. And here I'm going to click on new blank project and select video project. And here I simply want to upload the B-roll that we've just generated with video 3.1. So I'm going to select my first video, click open, and now it's being imported into 11 Labs. I'm then going to click on the video tab again and upload another video. Click on the second B-roll, click open, and now that is also imported into 11 Labs. And so now if I press play, >> though my form is synthesized, my message is clear. >> We've got the AI B-roll from VO3.1, but there's audio with it. and we don't want to use the audio because the audio isn't that good or it's not the audio that we want to use within our project. And so here I'm going to click on the clip and we're simply going to mute it. Now what I'm going to do here is I'm going to type out the narration or the voice over that I want said in my video. And so I prepared a little something earlier. And here I want to make sure that it's a good voice that's fitting to my story and my scene. And so here I'm going to go and click on the voice. And instead of using one of my voice clones, I want to find a different narrator voice. And so I might just type in narrator right here. And then we've got a few different narrator voices that appear. And so let's preview one. >> Calm, clear, articulate, every word delivered with purpose. >> I actually think this one could work quite nicely. So I'm just going to select it, click add to my voices. So it's added to my voice library. And now I'm simply going to click play. And then the voice over is going to be generated. >> As he began his speech, there was a shift in the room. You could feel it like the start of something important but fragile. He wasn't trying to impress anyone. He was just honest. So here I think this is pretty good. However, the B-roll scenes last a little bit too long. So what I might do is potentially trim one of them down so it cuts to the next one earlier and maybe trim off the beginning so it lands on that video in motion. And obviously this is the tutorial, so I'm not going to go ahead and generate every single B-roll scene, but you saw that it was pretty easy to generate as many B-roll scenes as you need. And then you just simply import them back and forth. And now I actually want to change this voice. So I'm just going to click on the voice again. I'm going to go back to narrator. And we're going to use one I already added to my voice library. Jim narrator. This one right here. And now the last thing that I want to do to bring the entire scene together is to add some background music. And so here within 11 Labs, I click on music. we can actually generate AI music simply by describing the song that we want to hear. And so here I'm going to type out ominous documentary music. I want to generate two variations of my prompt and I want it to be instrumental. And then this scene is quite short so I'm going to select 30 seconds for the duration. And then we click generate. And now we have two songs that have been generated which we can preview and directly add to my project. And to add them, I'm simply going to place the playhead where I want the music to begin. And then I click on the plus button on the song that I want to add. So let's select this one right here. And as you can see, it's now been imported. And I can actually trim off the end here because it doesn't need to be as long. And I might also want to trim off the beginning just a little bit. So it starts a little bit quicker and there's no blank silence at the beginning. And now if I click play, let's take a look. >> As he began his speech, there was a shift in the room >> here. The music's a little bit too loud. So, I'm just going to select it and then we turn it down a little bit. And so, we want this to be background music. So, let's just make it 32%. And then we click play again. >> As he began his speech, there was a shift in the room. You could feel it like the start of something important, but fragile. >> And so, that is how to create cinematic 3D AI B-roll using VO3.1 and then compiling it all together into a scene using 11 Lab Studio. And this AI workflow allows you to turn anything into a really compelling story. And we're going to leave you on an example to finish up the video. Thanks for watching. >> As Alec began his speech, there was a shift in the room. You could feel it like the start of something important but fragile. It would have been his best one yet, except it wasn't. [Music]"

Join me as I chat with Dan Koe where he shares his content creation system that allows him to efficiently produce high-quality content across multiple platforms. He explains how he uses Twitter as a testing ground for ideas, then repurposes successful content for newsletters, YouTube videos, and other social platforms. Dan demonstrates how he uses AI tools to research topics, generate content ideas, and analyze successful content structures without sacrificing his unique voice and perspective.

32:20 - Creating Viral Content with AI (Prompt Breakdown)

*Dan uses SuperX. Link: https://superx.so/?via=community

Key Points:
• Dan uses a systematic approach to content creation, starting with Twitter posts to validate ideas before expanding to other platforms
• He leverages AI tools (primarily Claude and ChatGPT) to research, summarize, and generate content ideas
• His weekly workflow includes writing newsletters that become YouTube videos, and creating 2-3 social media posts daily
• Dan uses specific AI prompts to analyze high-performing content and create frameworks for replicating successful formats

1) The Content Ecosystem Framework

Dan's entire content machine runs on just TWO core activities:
• ONE weekly newsletter (sometimes twice)
• 2-3 social media posts DAILY

He writes for Twitter FIRST (280 char limit) then repurposes EVERYWHERE:
• Threads
• Instagram
• LinkedIn
• YouTube scripts
• Reels/TikTok

2) The Newsletter Research Hack

Dan doesn't spend hours taking notes from research. Instead:

• Finds YouTube videos on his topic
• Uses Gemini 2.5 to summarize HOURS of content into digestible notes
• Has AI compare with his previous content to find connections
• Creates an outline from these insights

This turns 6+ hours of research into 1000 focused words!

3) The Idea Validation System

How does Dan know what to write about? Two brilliant approaches:

1. Use Twitter as a testing ground - when a tweet performs well, expand it into a newsletter
2. Study what ALREADY works - find top-performing YouTube videos in your niche, take the TOPIC (not the content), add your unique perspective

4) The AI Content Multiplier

After writing his newsletter, Dan runs it through THREE custom prompts:

• YouTube title generator (creates 20-30 titles based on his best performers)
• Deep post generator (extracts paradoxes, quotes, transformation arcs)
• Content ideas generator (60 ideas based on his top-performing formats)

5) The Daily Content Routine

Dan's productivity system is SHOCKINGLY simple:

• 2 hours of focused writing each morning
• Must complete one newsletter section
• Must write three social posts
• Schedule everything across platforms

That's it. Two hours daily = millions of followers across platforms.

6) The Follower Growth Formula
1. Experiment until you find a post type that generates followers
2. Create consistent ""spin-offs"" of that format (30% of content)
3. Use remaining 70% to experiment for the NEXT winning format
4. Cycle out older formats as new ones emerge

7) The AI Post Deconstruction Technique
1. Find posts you admire
2. Ask AI: ""Break down the structure of this post so I can recreate it""
3. Do this for 3 different posts
4. Have AI combine them into a ""complete guide""
5. Ask what context it needs from YOU
6. Create a custom prompt that interviews you then writes in that style

8) The Prompt Engineering Secret

Dan uses a ""prompt that helps create better prompts"" approach:
- First, get AI to break down what makes great content work
- Then, create a two-phase prompt:
    - Phase 1: Interview you for context
    - Phase 2: Generate content based on your answer

* affiliate relationship",AI workflow for content creation,122907,5303,310,2025-10,"If you've been on the internet, you've seen Danco. He's got millions of followers and I've seen him everywhere. So, I reached out to him and I was like, ""How do you do it?"" And he told me that his secret is LLM's, AI, and prompts. So, in this episode, he shows his exact playbook for coming up with ideas, creating the content, and most importantly, content that is going to go viral. Now, why I find this interesting is right now there's an unfair advantage to create X accounts, to create YouTube channels that get distribution. If you can figure out distribution, you could create a bunch of startups for those audiences. So, if you stick around to this end of this episode, you will understand how to create content like Danco. And, you know, people generally charge thousands of dollars for this. It's free. All I ask is for a like and a comment on this episode. I can't wait to see what you build. Have a creative day. [Music] >> What's up, Dan? Great to have you. By the end of this episode, what are people going to take out of it? Glad to be here, dude. Thank you for having me on. Uh, I have a few things to share, but the outcome as a whole will be a big picture overview of my content ecosystem. So before we just started, you were mentioning like uh you're curious about how my output is so high when I personally don't think it's that high. It doesn't take too much. So uh I think it just comes down to having a really smart system and then being able to augment that with AI in a unique way, which we're going to learn. But the other thing that we have to learn in order to do that well is just how to use LLMs in a way to get them to do exactly what you want. So I'm not a coder. I don't use too many of the fancy tools. Mostly just claw chat GPT. So how are we going to use the base tools that most people have access to and understand to create something incredible? >> I love it. I only have one ask from you. You know, I just ask that you don't hold back any sauce. You give the prompts. You show how it's really done. Because what would be success for me is if thousands of people consume this episode and understand how to use LLMs to be like you. Because when I see Dan Co, I see millions of followers. I see you everywhere. I see content here. I see content there. And I'm like, how does this guy do it? Dan, can you commit to it? >> Absolutely. Yep. All right, let's get into it. >> Cool. Uh, so the first thing there, just to touch on, uh, millions of followers, having so much content on so many different platforms. The the thing about that is all of my content is a same is the same across all different platforms. So the base of it all comes down to two things. It comes down to my newsletter, which I write every week, sometimes twice a week, but once a week is like baseline. And then two is two to three social media posts a day and those are usually written. And so I write Twitter first because it's like the 28 280 character limit. And then since that's like the limiting factor out of all the platforms that can pretty easily transfer over to any other platform. So that gets posted to threads by Instagram. I turn that into an image and post that onto LinkedIn onto Instagram. Sometimes I use them as a real script. So I pull up my camera, look at my phone, read my best tweet, recite it to the camera, maybe add a bit on there. Um, and then I have reals, Tik Toks, shorts, etc. And the good thing about that is since the ideas themselves are almost always validated ideas or have the potential to do very well, if I can nail the first idea that goes out on Twitter, then I'm practically nailing all the other content that goes out on all other platforms because I'm not much of a trend follower. Sometimes I am, but most of the time I believe that the algorithms are based off of human psychology. And if you understand human psychology and can use AI to help you understand that more, your content will see a notable increase in engagement and other things of that nature. So, uh, first I'll just give an overview in this canvas style so you understand my weekly process. So, every week I plan out my newsletter and the idea for the newsletter. It's based on a a few different things. It could be a top performing tweet of mine that I had before because I know that that tweet has already done well. So, I'm just going to take on it take it expand it into a newsletter that turns into a YouTube video podcast. Good to go. uh or it can be based on a video that is already doing well on YouTube. So a good way to generate ideas that help you grow is to go to YouTube, look at the accounts in your niche or the people the kind of like tribe you want to join online. Go to their account, go to videos, filter by most popular, and then just write down 10 of the videos that you think you could recreate. Now, the secret there is you're not watching the videos. You're not trying to steal anything from the video itself. You're trying to take the topic, the angle, and write your own perspective on it. Because if other people are watching those videos since they have a lot of views, then they're going to just by the nature of YouTube and people binge watching things, they're going to be recommended your video. They're going to watch that. And if they hear you say the same things as the other person, then you're not going to stand out or be unique. So that's what this process is. So that's usually the two ways that I come up with newsletter ideas. And I keep a document where I tend to I just have a list of ideas that I can pull from. I pick the one that I think is going to do the best that week. Now what I do for that is I of course have a place where I write the newsletter just in a note or document. But I tend to find a few things that I've either talked about before relating to that. So previous newsletters, previous tweets, whatever they may be. And then Sam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI just said that it is the era of the idea guy. And he is not wrong. I think that right now is an incredible time to be building a startup. And if you listen to this podcast, chances are you think so, too. Now, I think that you can look at trends uh to basically figure out uh what are the startup ideas you should be building. So, that's exactly why I built ideabser.com. Every single day, you're going to get a free startup idea in your inbox, and it's all backed by high quality data trends. How we do it, people always ask. We use AI agents to go and search what are people looking for and what are they screaming for in terms of products that you should be building and then we hand it on a you know silver platter for you to go check out. Um we do have a few paid plans that you know take it to the next level uh give you more ideas give you more AI agents and more almost like a chat GBT for ideas with it but you can start for free ideabrowser.com and if you're listening to this I highly recommend it. A lot of the times I like to weave in other concepts from specific books or videos. So this is where AI really comes into play because I'm talking about uh survival and how to reinvent yourself in this newsletter. And when I say survival, I'm talking about psychological survival, something that I find really unique and interesting. And I've previously watched three videos on that. They're each by a channel called actualize.org and they're like three hours long. So, it's a lot of learning when I'm on walks and other things of that nature that allows me to write in-depth newsletters, but I'm usually not taking notes during this time. And this is where LLMs can come into play because they can usually pull from YouTube videos or PDFs allowing you to talk to them and pull up the relevant points that you want to talk about in a newsletter. So the research process there is thinking about the newsletter and the topic I want to write, talking with AI a bit and just getting specific key points and summaries and uh other unique perspectives and maybe throwing in a few things about the topic that I'm talking about just so I have a chat that I can refer to that turns 6 hours of videos into a thousand words, right? So then I can write about it myself. >> Uh now the other thing here is if I bake in something I've written previously. So this is on reinventing yourself. It's kind of my thoughts on that. So you can think of this newsletter as like combining these two. So when I take the summary, paste it into another chat or link it to another chat, then I can say, okay, what are the similarities here? Is there anything that I'm missing? I'm kind of just in this process of ideiation with the LLM until I feel like I have enough firepower to start piecing together an outline and then to start writing it. Now, I don't have the LLM write for me, like the actual newsletter. Um, but with what we're going to talk about, you could technically do that. And if we have time, I'll actually show you how to do that specifically. But uh that's the research process. Nothing special here. Just getting information from the getting the ideas so that I can put them into the newsletter. Otherwise, you just get stuck staring at a blank screen. >> So I have a question on this. So what your thesis is basically you use X Twitter as a litmus test on ideas. >> Yes. And then once you have an idea that gets validated, then you're like, okay, this might have legs to extend this to other mediums. Then you look to YouTube as a encyclopedia of knowledge. you find popular videos um or or videos that just are high quality that you know might be you know might be it might be hours long and then you use looks like you use Gemini in the first example to summarize it. You can use you know really anything you want, right? Yeah, I I tend to go with Gemini 2.5, especially when there's Oh, this one's only 9 minutes, but for like the three to six hour videos, I'll use Gemini just because the large context window, >> right? So, you get smart about the videos and then from that you you extend it, right? And you're you're not using the LMS to at this point write it. But um I guess my question is cuz someone someone listening this is going to be like okay but you never talked about the hardest part which is your great ideas on Twitter. You know what I mean? >> So >> how do you think about that? >> So it's kind of circular, right? The ideas for Twitter can come from two different places. It can come from the newsletter itself. So I'll show over here in a second, but they can come from the newsletter itself and that's a good way to generate ideas. But the mistake that people make there is they'll have a really good newsletter and they'll think, ""Okay, I'm supposed I'm supposed to pull ideas from this and they'll read a certain sentence or paragraph and just try to copy paste that directly and post it on Twitter with a maybe a few changes when in reality what you're looking for is just the idea that you can turn into a high performing tweet. So, it's kind of the same thing there where the first step is learning how to write high performing tweets. And there's courses on there. There's courses on this. There's YouTube videos on this. The best thing I can recommend is actually what I'm going to show you, but you need to kind of immerse yourself in good writing and ideas. I think the best thing you can do to write better social content in general is to just keep a swipe file of really good ideas that you'd like to emulate under your own brand. I think of brand as the ideas that you associate yourself with. And so you're not necessarily copying other people's ideas or taking other people's ideas. You're synthesizing a bunch of different ideas that are technically what compose your mind and your worldview and you're bringing them together in a very articulate way under your own brand and then as people consume those over time you gain that authority in their head. So uh that's one way to come up with ideas is just keep a swipe file. You have to become like a ruthless notetaker and just consistently save ideas until it's until you've read so many of them and written so many of them that it's become second nature to you on how to just structure an idea. Like you can give me a word and then if you give me a minute to think about it, I could probably come up with a really good post about that thing. >> And do you use any tools for that? Um, I use, if we go to Twitter, so I've used both Tweet Hunter X and SuperX. It It feels like >> a lot of people or no company has really mastered this yet, just the Twitter sidebar in general, where when you go to a certain person's profile, this is the Super X extension, and it just shows their top performing tweets. So if you write down five to 10 accounts that you really like uh and you kind of want to I think you refine your writing style by reading the writing you aspire to have. And so if you have the accounts that talk like you want to talk and you consistently visit their highest performing tweets with SuperX or Tweet HunterX and save all of these down and try to exchange either the structure or the idea and practice posting. What I mean by that is right here there's a clear structure. Go on more walks, walk for no reason, walk to solve a problem, etc., etc. You can take this structure or bring another idea into it. So rather than walks it could be code code more code every day something of that nature. And then the more you or that's exchanging the taking the structure and exchanging the idea from it. But you can also take an idea like go on more walks and exchange the structure of it. So then you look at another structure where this is just a single sentence uh I don't know platitude of sorts this one at least and you can just take the idea of walks try to write it as a single sentence now you have two tweets from one idea. Um, and the more you do that and practice it, then really any idea has the potential to do very well cuz you can just pop it into a pre-existing structure or you can take a structure and plug in one of the ideas that you're trying to include in your brand. So, uh, one thing there that I'll talk on and then we'll get into actually doing all of that. Uh what the after I write the newsletter, I have three prompts that I like to run it through. So this first one is just a YouTube title generator. And I'll show you how this one's structured. And if you do this, Greg, I can uh put all of these in a Google doc so people can copy paste them and read through them and dissect how they're structured. But for this prompt specifically, I uh wrote a prompt. I took my best like 15 titles on YouTube and I whatever I plug into it, the newsletter I plug into it, it pulls out the key points from that newsletter and tries to spin them into uh 20 to 30 YouTube titles that are similar and follow the same psychological patterns and principles as my best performing titles. And so it spits these out here and then I tend to read through these, cross out ones that I don't think would work, highlight ones that I think would potentially come up with a better one from my own mind, test that out on YouTube. If it doesn't work after 2 weeks, I'll try changing the title. Usually that'll get it to a decent place in terms of views. And the reason I create YouTube titles for this is because my newsletter is a practically an outline for my YouTube videos, right? I have it pulled up as I'm looking at the screen, I mean at the camera. I'll look down, read a sentence, recite it to the camera. Sometimes I'll riff. Sometimes I'll read straight from it. uh if I'm looking down and reading at the newsletter, my editor just adds B-roll or text screens over my face so people can't see me looking down. But that's the general structure of it and people quite like it. The objection there usually is uh well, if you're posting the same thing on two platforms, won't people notice that or won't they get bored? Right? >> And most of the time, I've seen the opposite. Like there are people that read it and then when they watch or listen to it, they get something entirely new because it's a different medium. Other people prefer to watch or listen rather than read. And I I just feel like my philosophy behind it is I'd rather produce one amazing thing a week and just put all of my attention into that and put it out across all platforms rather than try to create something new for each platform and each of those things not be as good. And there's probably marginal difference between the two paths, but I've really gotten into this flow of the weekly flow of newsletter, YouTube video, social posts across all platforms, and it's worked out pretty well. People don't get angry, and it's seems like it's working. But the next thing I do is I'll take the newsletter or the YouTube video and I'll plug them into a deep post generator prompt and just a content ideas generator. And these are both kind of the same thing. For the deep post generator, I wrote a prompt that breaks it breaks down the newsletter or whatever you feed it. It could be a PDF, a YouTube video, anything. And I came up with this prompt. It's still kind of fuzzy how I did it because it was like a huge conversation, but I broke down I asked it to break down a bunch of these social posts that I really liked. Uh the way they were structured, the way they were written, and the key things that made them do really well. And after that conversation, it said, ""Okay, well, a lot of these have paradoxes and counterintuitive truths. A lot of them have a transformation arc. A lot of them have core problems. Uh, a lot of them have examples or they handle objections or they have action steps or aspirational statements."" And so I was like, ""Okay, take each one of these and uh break down the newsletter, whatever you're fed, into like five compelling post ideas, like the most impactful ideas that could be turned into posts. And then I want you to ideulate three core paradoxes, a bunch of key quotes, transformation arc, core problems, key examples."" So with this, I'm not asking it to write tweets for me because the LLM isn't going to be too good at doing that unless you guide it to in a very specific way. But instead here is I have it give me the pieces of ideas like the the deconstruction of high-erforming content and ideas and just give me a bunch of those. And so I can read through here and when one thing sparks an idea for me, boom, I can go and start writing a tweet on that. Or I can combine a bunch of these together since technically each of these like all of these paradoxes, quotes, problems are all related. They're all about one idea. So I just have a bunch of building blocks for good content in here. The next prompt that I use is just a general content idea generation. And I have it give me 60 ideas. And these are usually based around the tweets that have done really well for me or the social post in general. I found that people really like when I give harsh life advice and I like that too. Uh counterintuitive truths which is very similar to the paradoxes. core problems or pain points. Again, very similar key insights, wisdom, big ideas. So, I can just read through here and I'm not technically I'm not trying to copy paste these as a tweet. I'm just trying to generate a starting point for an idea so that I can have those ideas faster, right? because I feel like good ideas are the fuel for content, but usually good ideas come from sifting through hours of YouTube videos on a walk or reading a good book or uh read finding a really good Substack article and having that generate ideas or just sitting and thinking with your thoughts until something emerges. And those are great ways to come up with ideas, but this is just a way to kind of force that to an extent and still maintain the quality without having the LLM actually write it for you. Now, so we just went over like in general how I go over or how I create my newsletters and content each week. That's just the writing ideiation process. How I actually structure that on a day-to-day basis is quite simple where I wake up, do a little morning routine, shower, walk, whatever it may be, and then I sit down at my computer and the next two hours is just dedicated to writing. So in that writing, I have to finish one section of my newsletter and I have to finish three posts, three social posts. And then within that time, you usually have time within that two hours still to paste those social posts to all platforms or at least schedule them. And so that's kind of my routine every day. It's just 2 hours of writing. And that's the base of all of my social media, all of my newsletter. Uh, one day out of the week, I record my YouTube video and pass that off to the editor. And then boom, my content is done. And the rest is history. You got millions, millions of followers, millions of likes. Well, that that was the other thing that I found relatively quick is once I had a post that started to generate more followers than other ones did, I knew that I just had to start creating spin-offs of that post because then it's like I almost had a predictable way to increase the follower growth. So, it's like the the key part here is one, you need to experiment until you kind of strike gold and know what brings in followers. Then you need to make that a consistent part of your process and consistently create spin-offs of that while with your other time. And let's say that's 30% of the time. That's like one post a day out of the three. The other two posts are for continuing the experimentation on until you find the next one that is like you striking gold. Then you make that a part of your process. Now you have two posts a day that are just consistently most like they they're not all going to bring in a ton of followers, but you're getting closer and closer to just consistently increasing followers over time by doing this. And if you keep that balance of your core ideas that are consistently going to bring in followers with a healthy dose of experimentation until you find more and then you just cycle out the core ideas. That's really the entire growth process on any social platform in my opinion. >> So there's there's one thing that's missing from this which is visual assets like media. So on X, I've noticed that like if I tweet just words versus I tweet words with an image, the words with image, you know, call it performs 40% better. Um, and so how do you think about that? How do you think, you know, okay, you do this process to come up with ideas to write the content, but what do you do about the image? I don't do anything. But but that's just me. Um because I've ever since I started out, I kind of put the constraint on myself of like I want to do this with just writing. I I didn't start YouTube until I think 2 years after I was on Twitter. And ju just by creating that constraint, it made me be more creative and I think it made me refine my writing a lot more. I've occasionally incorporated visuals in my Instagram posts uh and newsletters for like drawing out specific concepts or having certain infographics or I even did animations on Instagram at one point and those things definitely helped but uh the animations eventually died down because a lot more people started doing them. And then same with the visuals. Like I noticed they were a good pattern interrupt when I would post those after not posting them for a while and they would get a lot more engagement. But then if I tried to make that a consistent thing, they would just balance out as most of the posts did. And so then I'm like, I should just stick with writing because the ideas in in my head, the thing that I feel built my audience the most, there's no way to know this, but I think it came from my focus on idea density and novel perspectives. So, in my YouTube videos especially, I try to bake in at least one thing that I think will like blow people's minds as an exaggeration. It's like the thing that I found so interesting that I feel like not too many people know about. If I can find a way to incorporate that into a newsletter that has a pretty broad and validated angle, so people go into the video because it's already validated. they like that topic, they'll just watch it to watch it. And then I have a good hook, a good lead, and then I lead them into like that mind-blowing insight that makes them think a bit deeper and learn something new and have something new to explore that gives them this unique connection with me that not too many other people do. >> Yeah. I mean, >> does that make sense? >> It does. cuz I think like if you have really good optimized ideas, you don't need visuals, it's just so hard to come up with good ideas. I mean, you're sharing the sauce around how to come up with good ideas, but it it's by the way, it's not just good ideas. It's good ideas that are optimized for feeds, >> right? because >> you need people to reshare it to get seen um or like it or comment on it. You you need them to stop scrolling to to you know. So for a lot of people the images or the videos are a bit of a crutch like you can take a not so good idea crutch it to a really nice visual and likely you you'll get more seen. I think I do think that if you added images or and or videos to your ex posts, you would see not that you need, you know, another 5 million impressions a month, but I think the way I would I mean I think it's fun to explore like Sora 2 just came out. >> Um, you know, what are some short films, cinematic films that you can, you know, you could be creating. That's one. The other thing is, you know, Nano Banana, Gemini Flash 2.5, >> you know. Okay, I'll show you something real quick. Actually, go to my my ex. So, I had a um post that I posted that got like no like scroll, keep scrolling. It's like a It's a lot. It's a lot down, but I had a post um Yeah, I'll let you know when that basically didn't go anywhere and then I reposted it with an image. There it is. Stop. It went up. Went up. There it is. The cringe mountain one. H. So, I posted this. Everything I ever got in life was because I climbed cringe mountain. You sweat, you shake, you look stupid. And then one day it breaks open and suddenly you're the only one with the view. It went nowhere without the, you know, Yeah. basically nowhere without the image, but once the image com combined with, you know, maybe it wasn't a great idea, maybe it was a pretty good idea with, I think, a really great image. It it got 148,000 impressions. And by the way, I hear you listening to this and you're like, ""Yeah, but you have 500,000 followers or whatever."" The followers don't really matter anymore, realistically. >> You know, it's actually easier to get impressions if you have less followers. It's, you know what I mean? >> Yeah. >> Like I can post something that is >> just like a throwaway tweet and it will go nowhere. It'll get like a hundred likes compared to a typical 2 to 3,000. And yeah, it's just the the audience is definitely a force amplifier, but only if you're good at that thing. Like if if most people who haven't practiced writing content for a long amount of time were given a million followers, I do not think that that would help them in the slightest. >> Yeah. Cool. >> But yeah, let's actually show a cool way to do this with uh Claude or in in creating a prompt to help you write tweets or to help you, I guess, learn how to write those high performing posts. So, one thing I love to do is there's a two-step process here. Anything that I like and want to incorporate into my work, I will ask Claude or Chat GPT to break it down, teach me how to do it, I will take that as if it were a an SOP or just a set of instructions. Then I will take a prompt that helps me create prompts, send that, paste the instructions into it and say, I want to turn this into a prompt that interviews me for the exact thing you need in order to execute on this as best as possible. So as an example here is I said break down the structure of this post so that I can recreate it from scratch. break down why it works, the psychological patterns involved, what context is needed from me, and anything else I would need to understand how to recreate it. Then I just pasted I believe this is one of my tweets that did pretty good. Uh how to know you were doing something meaningful. You feel like you don't make any progress for weeks, months, or years. Then the growth hits you all at once. When you create your own path, results aren't predictable, and that keeps many people from sticking with it. So, you find a good post. Well, first you write this, tell it to break it down. You find a good post that you want to understand why it did so well or how it was written. But this can also be applied to something like a landing page or if you're trying to write a book and you read someone else's book and you're like, damn, that paragraph was good. I want to understand how I can take my own idea and replicate the structure of this so my writing flows the same amount. Um, you can do that for writing YouTube scripts if you're able to break down the transcript. There's just so many different things that you can do. Uh, I actually saw when Culie first launched, they had a landing page that I really liked and I copy pasted the landing page, wrote exactly this, told it to break down every single part of the landing page copy and it called it paradigm shift marketing and just taught me exactly how to replicate it. So when I could take that and turn it into a prompt and then plug my own ideas for my own product into it, then it could rewrite that same style of copy but with my product, my features, my problem that I'm solving, unique mechanism, etc. So with here uh we're breaking down a tweet and it breaks down the core structure, hook statement, pain and struggle, the payoff, the insight and warning, why it works. And just by doing this alone, you can learn so much about writing content. you you like this alone is a master class in writing one piece of content and then you can continue conversing with it and that helps you write better content on your own. Then it gives you a formula additional elements to make this work. And then what I did here is I did the same thing do the same thing with this and I took one of Zack Pogra's tweet and or Instagram posts and it was just the best way to get your spark back is burning everything down. You have to reset your life. Very similar to the things I like to read and write. And so I like this. I want it to break it down. I told it to. It has It broke down the structure, provocative thesis, purge list, the promise, the elite few, the permission, teaches me why it works, writing techniques, context needed, what makes it work, and then I did the same thing for one last tweet. So do the same thing with this again. People in third People in third world countries spend their days talking, playing, dancing, and making love. People in first world countries aspire to spend their days talking, plans, playing, dancing, and making love. I think about this often. This was just one I found and I'm like, that's a good idea. I'll throw it in here, too. So, the process of this is pretty much break down three tweets that you really like and then combine all of these into a singular guide. So now the anatomy of viral philosophical posts a complete guide breaks down the three archetypes which were the tweets and then core psychological patterns technical structure power techniques. >> This is insane. This is absolutely >> manipulation. It's it's really cool. And like well imagine doing this for more than just tweets like YouTube scripts and other things like the this is where it starts to all tie together. Once you use this process a few you use this process a few times you realize that you can use it for almost anything. And then if you rewind this podcast to looking at the canvas that I was showing you, you can now see that each chat in there was one of these prompts that I created. So, if I want to turn my newsletter into tweets and I use this there, then it like that's so much better than me pasting my newsletter into an LLM and being like, ""Hey, what are 10 of the best ideas from this? Can you write a tweet? Have write 10 tweets for me."" And then it writes like the worst tweets you've ever read and still includes hashtags. So this is like how you give the inspecific instructions so that it can write like you or write how you want it to and then you can paste those directly if you'd like or you can use those as ideas to like as a first draft a starting point. Now the last important thing here is I said from that guide what is everything you would need from me in order to start writing tweets. Everything I need to know from you. Core identity, audience psychology, philosophical stance, voice parameters, specific insights, transformation, narrative, emotional territory, so on and so forth. A lot of stuff. So, we're making this very comprehensive because the context is king. the the more context you give to the AI, the more it can get close to putting out what you actually want it to put out or putting out things that will blow your mind and that you feel confident in replicating week by week in your content. So now we have two things here. We have a description of the context we need and we have instructions for how to actually write posts. So what I did next is I took these two things. I personally pasted them into just a separate note and then start a new chat. And what I did here is I have this special this thing is a lifesaver. I use it all the time. It's just a prompt that helps you create better prompts. So, uh I can share this in some way with you guys after, but it just it it's so good. You just have to try it. makes very comprehensive prompts. Um, maybe you can pause, read through this if you'd like, but I send that and then I try to use the most powerful. I know 4.5 just came out, but 4 point I use 4.1 extended thinking on this because I just like to be as advanced as I can when I'm creating a specific prompt. And what I did or said, what is the topic or role of the prompt you want to create? I said I want to create a prompt that helps me ideulate social posts based on the guide from writing posts below. Structure this prompt in two phases. The first is context gathering. So interview me for the ideas that I want to write about. And phase two is postw writing. So write three variations of each type of post using the ideas I gave you. Here's the additional context. So inside of here on this one, I didn't paste the context that it needed from me, but I could have. Right? In phase one, I could have said, ""Use the uh guide on what context you need from me in order to create interview questions that you can ask me."" And then phase two, use the tweet writing guide to take everything I gave you and turn them and turn them into tweets. And so what it did after that, sometimes this prompt will ask clarifying questions um if it has them to make the prompt better. But then it starts to spit out the prompt and it has phase one context gathering interview. Oh, I guess I did paste it in there, >> right? >> So it's somewhere in the thing. But the when you send this prompt for writing tweets, it goes through it asks you what your domain and expertise is, audience painoint, unique observation, transformation, vision, personal connection, uh what tone, specific examples, and then once it has enough information, it'll go into phase two, which is to generate nine posts using uh yeah, three variations of the patient observer post, which was one of the examples. uh three variations of the dramatic profit post, three variations of the quiet devastator posts, post structure requirements, constraints, output format, and then I just had it rewrite it as markdown without the code block so that I could paste that into my notes because not a coder, don't use cursor, any of that, but I just keep things in notes. But, uh, Greg, do you have questions on this? >> What's going through my mind is like it feels like I've been doing content like a Neanderl, you know? That's that's what it feels like cuz I just I just >> brute force my way into it, you know? I just I have an idea and I d, you know, and I, you know, I start typing and then I just throw it out there. Um, it works for me. Um, and sometimes, you know, do what works type thing. >> Oh, yeah. >> Um, that being said, what's going through my mind is we we have a lot of accounts, you know, cuz I run a holding company and >> I find that some of my, you know, I love my team, but some of my team haven't been creating content. Like, I've been writing, you know, I started a blog 20 years ago, you know what I mean? I've been writing for so many years that it's just kind of uh it's it's inst it's it's my instincts almost now. Um so this is really helpful for managing multiple accounts with multiple people and you really don't have an excuse not to be posting something every single day if you have this. >> Yeah. I mean, another way to think of it, too, is if you're a ghostriter, social media manager, uh you're managing clients, you can kind of send them a prompt that gets all of their you send it to them rather than like a onboarding questionnaire that pulls all of their details from them, gets examples of their best content, etc., etc., and then you just create prompts for like tweets, tweet writing for them. you create another prompt for YouTube script writing or landing page generation all based around their voice, their profile, etc. And one last example that I'll share here is you can do a very similar thing for almost anything where imagine I know how to create offers. I've like been in the marketing space for so long. But a lot of people just starting, they have this superpower where they can start learning by doing faster, right? You're it's not that you're avoiding reading a book like a hund00 million offers by Alex Hermoszi. You're able to get the information you need to act and have AI act for you as a first draft so you get the first iteration out of the way as well. So you can fail faster on creating your offer so that you can refine faster. And in my eyes, doing things this way isn't like outsourcing your agency or your cognition to AI. It's actually getting you closer to being high agency and uh learning through doing like right the the best way to learn is by building projects, failing, iterating, etc. So the example here and how to turn this into a prompt to create an offer and start selling and failing on whatever product it is, a SAS startup, a physical product, a digital product, whatever. Uh I can just ask, give me a detailed guide on how to create offers like Alex Horoszi. The reason we do this rather than, hey, here's my product, help me create an offer from it is because I want to narrow the context from the beginning, right? I don't want AI. I I don't want the LLM to pull just general context that it thinks is best for creating an offer or writing copy. I want it to pull from the expert that I know has skin in the game here. So, it gives me a detailed guide with the value equation, building a grand slam offer, pricing, 10x value test, naming your offer, etc., etc. And I think when I was doing this I cut myself off. But what you can do here is then I can say okay take this and act as if you are guiding me through creating an offer. What are the exact steps? make it extremely detailed and then I can do the same thing I did here or sorry then I can ask next okay what's all the context you need from me uh in order to take my product and turn it into a very good offer then it'll spit all that out now you have two things you have the set of instructions and you have the context that you need so the next thing you do is you paste the prompt that helps you create great prompts it's going to say what do you want to create I say, ""I want to create a two-phase prompt. Here's the information that you need to interview me for."" Then phase two, here's exactly how to turn this into an offer. So, I want you to create my offer blueprint for me. And then you, it'll output a prompt. You copy paste this. You send it. You answer the questions. It spits out an offer blueprint that is probably 10 times better than something you would have done on your own just then, right? And it would probably be on par with what you would be able to do after two to three months of actually learning about it. And I believe that is it. Well, you delivered, dude. I I you know that's why I wanted to have you >> you actually overd delivered to be honest >> nice >> and because you know I think uh my mind is just racing with how much more I can do with content and and I you know what are other audiences I could be spinning up using this method. Um if you can uh yes let's include that Google doc or or that doc with some of this in the show notes. Um, and I appreciate that generosity. Dan Co, I hope you come back on the pod. I'll include links to where you can follow Dan on YouTube, on X, his newsletter. Uh, what else, Dan? >> That's it. You'll, if you're curious, you'll find stuff that branches off of that. >> Amazing. Thanks, Dan. I really appreciate it. And uh dude, takes a lot for me to get to get my to get my mind buzzing, but you did. You did it. >> Good. Yeah, I appreciate it, man. And I'm glad that it did provide value. That's one thing I'm always like hopeful for because you never really know. I've used this so much that it's like second nature to me. So, I'm very glad. I mean, I've used LLMs with content, like how can you make this more clear or you know that that kind of stuff, but I I this the way you approach content creation is a very methodical way of approaching content creation. It's like very surgical. And um by the way, I think this is the best way to learn how to create content. you you might actually like everyone should set this up. >> Maybe over time you you you're like, you know what, I'm just gonna now I understand what works and what doesn't work. I'm just going to shoot from the hip like Greg. Um and that might be what you what might, you know, end up being great for you. Or you might be like, hey, uh I'm going to double down on this and I'm going to make 20 accounts and that's what this is going to look like, you And I think I'm really interested in that because um I just think that we're in this window where there's a huge o arbitrage opportunity to earn attention. So you know any any way to help that you know I'm looking I'm looking for ways looking for ways to optimize. >> Yep. Agreed. Danco Startup Ideas podcast thanks for coming on. Thank you, Matt."

So, what I'm going to do today is show you guys how you can use Nitend to get 10 times the output, higher quality outputs, no watermarks, and use Sor 2 for six times cheaper than through OpenAI directly. So, Sor 2 has some really fun use cases, and I love that it's getting people who aren't super interested into AI interested in AI. But it's more than just having these funny, cool videos. Businesses and organizations are actually using Sora 2 to power their creatives, their media, their content, their marketing, all this kind of stuff. Not only does it create video, but it automatically creates the audio, too. Just look at this Starbucks example. >> Starbucks. Discover your flavor. >> So, if you understand how to use this technology, not only can you save yourself or a business a ton of time, but you could make a lot of money. So anyways, today I'm going to be showing you guys step by step how to connect to SOR 2 in NADN over API, but then I'm also going to be going over these examples where you can do text to video, image to video. You can have cameos, so people like Mark Cuban or Sam Alman in your Sor 2 videos. You can create storyboards so you can lay out different scenes and have consistent characters throughout. And then I'm also going to talk about prompting. So feel free to follow along. I'm going to give you guys this entire template for free so that you guys don't have to actually go build this yourself. You can just use what I have here already. And you can access that by joining my free school community. The link for that will be in the description, but I don't want to waste any time. Let's get straight into the video. All right, so before we dive into these examples, I want to start from scratch and show you guys how I connect to Sora 2 in Naden. So the first step is to go to a platform called Key AI, which is what we were just looking at over here. It's spelled Kie.ai. In the past, you guys have seen me use foul.ai, which is a very, very similar platform. Essentially, it's just like a marketplace for all of these image and video generation models, as you can see here. But here's the key difference on price. FAL and OpenAI are charging you 10 cents per second of Sora 2 video generation whereas keys only charging you 1.5 cents per second. So it's six times cheaper to make these videos. And of course you're still getting the same quality of output if not better. If we make a 10-second video, that's only going to cost us 15. Whereas on Fowl or OpenAI, that 10-second video would cost us a dollar. Anyways, the first thing you're going to do when you get to key.ai is go to your billing information and just make sure you have some credits. You'll probably have some for free when you get in there, but otherwise just grab five bucks worth. It's going to last you a long time. And then on the lefth hand side, you can see there's a section called API key. And we'll have to use this in just a minute or so, but just remember for now, that's where it is. But anyways, I'm going to click on models market. We have all of these different providers and options we can use like Google Vo 3.1, Sora 2 Pro, and for now, I'm just going to go ahead and click on Sora 2. And so this opens up a playground environment where you could write in here start to prompt Sora 2 and get your outputs right here just to play around with how the prompting works and how the outputs look. But what we're interested in is using this over API. So I'm on Sora 2 textto video and I'm going to click on API right here. And now all we have to do is scroll to the bottom and I'm going to show you guys how we can set up a curl which makes it really really easy. You can see down here there is a request example and you make sure you're on curl and then we're going to copy this right here. I'm going to go back into Nitn. I'm going to add an HTTP request to our workflow. And I don't have to configure this method, this URL, any of this stuff. I'm just going to go ahead and hit import curl. Paste in that curl command that we just copied. And then when I import it, it basically fills out pretty much everything that we need. Now, we just have to make a few tweaks. So, the first step would be to add your API key. So, right here it says authorization and then it says bearer space API key. And so, this is where you would go back into key. You go to your API key and you'd copy this value right here. And then you're just going to paste that right there like that. And then you'd be able to access key. And this would basically access your billing information that you put in there. But because we're going to be making multiple requests to key, I don't want to copy and paste this every single time I want to make a request. I just want to save this. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to scroll up a little bit. And right here you can see authentication. I'm going to go ahead and open this up and click on generic. For generic type, I'm going to go ahead and choose header because you can see right here, this is a header parameter. And then you can see I have all of these different ones that I've already saved. You can also see that I already have one for key, but I'm just going to go ahead and make a new one with you guys right here to show you how it works. So, you click on create new credential. And remember, it's the same thing as we just saw down there. So, for the name, we're going to type in authorization. And for the value, you're going to type in capital B bearer space and then paste in your API key. And then when you go ahead and save that, now you're connected to key and you can name this credential like keyai and save that. And so now I have this saved every single time that I need to use key, which as you can see in this workflow, each one of these little workflows is one that we're going to be using key. So now I just have it saved and all I'd have to do is choose it right there rather than go back and copy my API key every time. So just a little fun trick. And then once you do that, you can just turn off the headers cuz we don't need to send our API key twice. But from here, what we have is the JSON body. And I'm just going to change this to an expression and open this up full screen so we can all look at it. So what we're looking at here is basically all of the little filters that we're sending over to Sora 2 and saying this is the type of video we want. We can see we have model is Sora 2 textto video. We have a callback URL, which I'm just going to go ahead and delete because that's an optional field. The only reason I know that's optional is because in this API documentation is what it's called. It basically shows you what you need to send over. So you can see the model that's required callback URL optional input prompt required aspect ratio optional. So you can actually go ahead and look at this API documentation and understand how you can change the behavior of the Sor2 API. So I'm not going to dive too deep into that right now. If you want to deep dive, I made a full course on that. You can go ahead and watch that video. I'll tag it right up here. Anyways, going back into Nitn, we can see that we have a prompt. We have um an aspect ratio. We have a number of frames which we can choose between 10 or 15. And then we have remove watermark true. So right here, what I'm going to do is just change this prompt. And this is turning our text into video. So I could just say a video of a young man throwing a coffee mug against the wall. So we have our JSON body ready. What I'm going to do now is hit execute step. So this just executed. It gave us a 200 code which is good. It says success. And then we see our task ID is this long string. So if we go back to the documentation now, we can see what happens is when we make that request, Sora 2 or key basically says, okay, we got this request. We're working on it. And so what we need to do next is actually grab that back. So there's another endpoint right here that says query task. I'm going to click on that. And all I'm going to do is copy this curl statement once again. So the request example, I'm going to copy that. We're going to come back into NAN and we're going to add another HTTP request and once again we're just going to import that curl. And so this is going to set us up with what we need. The first thing you'll notice is that we have a task ID parameter. So basically it's saying what request are you looking to get back. So I'm going to delete this example task ID and all I have to do is drag in the task ID that we just got from the previous node. So I'll put that right there. Now that's a dynamic expression. And then the last thing you can see is once again it's sending over our API key. So, I'm just going to turn off the headers because we know we already set this up up here as a generic as a header. And then we should have our key API somewhere in here. There we go. Key AI. And so, now we're set up once again. And so, I'm going to go ahead and execute this step. And you can see when I run that, it comes back and it says, okay, the state is generating. And while this is generating, I'll just show you guys in key how you can actually check on your requests. So, if I go to my logs, you can see right now that this says it's running. And you can see my past runs have taken 195 seconds, 227 seconds. So it may just take like 3 to four minutes for us. But this lets us look at all of our inputs. So we can see our prompts. We can see all of the things that we've requested from um these different models. So anyways, I'll check back in with you guys once this one is done. Okay, so I ran it again and you can now see that it says state equals success. And then down here, what we get is a result. So we got two different URLs. We got one with a watermark and one without a watermark. So, if I go ahead and copy this URL and I just basically say go to this URL, it downloads a file. And when I open up that download, this is what I get. Okay, that's pretty ridiculous. And first of all, what you'll notice is it was like it was in slow motion. The sound was a little weird. And the reason why this all happened is because we hardly prompt this thing at all. If you remember in the request that we made, I literally just said a video of a young man throwing a coffee mug against a wall. And so, you really can't expect to get a good output if you don't prompt it very well. And so, I'll talk a little bit later about prompting and how you can really get some cool outputs from Sora 2. But anyways, the point of what I just did there right up here was just to show you guys that we're making two requests. The first one we set up to say, ""Hey, Sora, here's the type of video I want."" The second one we set up to say, ""Okay, Sora, is that video done yet? Like, can I can I see it?"" Basically, so we're basically going to follow that pattern for all of these different workflows and it will start to make sense. But like I said, you'll be able to download all of this. So you'll be able to play around with it and see. The first example that we have here is turning text into video, which is kind of what we just did up here. But what I wanted to introduce to you guys is this concept of polling. So let me real quick start this request and then I'll explain what polling is. So, if you guys got into this template, all you'd have to do is go to this video prompt node. And right here, you could basically just input your video prompts of what you want to get back. So, right here, we have the default example about a professor giving a lecture and explaining that Sor 2 is live. So, what I'm going to do is execute this workflow. We're going to see this run. We can see what happened here is it made the request. So, Sor 2 is currently working on our video. Then, we have a wait node because we know this takes anywhere from, you know, 2 to 3 to 4 minutes. But what you just saw happen is we checked in to see if it was done after the wait node and it's not done yet and it just happened again. So this is going to be an infinite check where it's going to every 10 seconds go ask sor 2 if it's done until we know for a fact that it is done. And this is called polling because we're constantly making checks. And this is better than just estimating and saying okay well roughly this takes 3 minutes so I'm going to just set my weight for 4 minutes to be safe. Well that could be inefficient. And also what happens if for some reason it takes five minutes and then your flow moves on and there's just a big error. So anyways, the reason why this works is because in this if node what I'm doing is if I just make this section a little bit bigger over here, the state equals generating. And what I'm doing is I'm saying if the state equals success, then we're good. And then we go up the true branch. But you can see we've had six items come through and they've all gone through the false branch because the state equals generating. There was another seventh one. So, it's a super simple conditional check. We're just looking to see if it's done or not. Now, one thing you would want to consider is potentially using a switch node because there's other states that could happen. You could get success. You could get generating. You could potentially get failed. And if you get failed, it wouldn't really know what to do here. So, if you wanted to make this more production ready, you would probably also work in a conditional check to see if the state equals failed. And that would send you some sort of notification or something like that. All right. So, that just finished up. You can see that it took 18 tries, so about 180 seconds. And then what we get at the end is our final video URL. I did a quick expression within this JSON variable to isolate just the link that we want. So, I'm going to go ahead and open this up and we'll take a look. >> And here's the exciting part. Sora 2 is now available on Kai AI, making it easier than ever to create stunning videos. >> You can experiment, iterate, and bring your wildest ideas to life right from your lap. >> Okay, I mean, that's pretty good. You can see there's dialogue. You can see there's energy. And once again, we didn't even really put any best practices with prompting into play yet. So, we'll show that near the end of the video. But let's move on to this next example, which is turning an image into video, which is really, really cool. And I think this is what unlocks tons of potential. So, what we have here is similar. When you guys get in here, you'll have an image URL. So, right here, I have this image URL, which if I open this up real quick, you can see it's a AI generated image of a fake curl cream product for your hair. And then if we go to the video prompt, you can see I'm basically saying a realistic UGC style video of a young woman with curly hair sitting in her car recording a selfie style video explaining what she loves about the product. So UGC ads is a huge use case here because that's like what converts really well nowadays online on Tik Tok shop, stuff like that is just real authentic people holding something with a selfie style, you know, video and just saying, ""This product is awesome. This is why I love it."" And so imagine you have a product and you can just pump out five organic videos like that every single day without hiring actors or anything like that. So what I'm going to do is just go ahead and run this workflow and then we'll dive into once again how it's working. So you can see we have the polling flow set up very similar to the way we had it up here. The only difference really is in this HTTP request to key is we have the video model which is not text to video. Now it's imageto video. We have the prompt once again, but now we have a section called image URLs. We're sending over that public image which the model will use as reference. So in our final video, it should be holding the product that looks exactly the same as our source image. As you can see here, I said nothing about the product from the source image should change. It should appear exactly as given. We're also telling Sora that the woman in the video should say, ""I absolutely love this curl cream. It keeps my hair bouncy, curly, and lightweight all day long. You guys have to try it."" So you can have full control over what the AI person in the video is saying. You could also control their accent and their tone and their style, that kind of stuff, too. Just keep in mind that for this image URL, it has to be a publicly accessible file. So, it can't be local. And then for aspect ratio, we said portrait, and that's pretty much the only difference because we want it to be like a Tik Tok or an Instagram reel style. So, this is running. This is doing its polling check. And I will check in with you guys once it is finished up. All right, we just got that one back. Let's go ahead and take a look at this video. >> I absolutely love this curl cream. It keeps my hair bouncy, curly, and lightweight all day long. You guys have to try it. >> Okay, that's insane. If you guys see what happened here at the end, she puts it near the camera and this looks pretty much identical to the source image that we had. It has the same font. It has all of the words looking really good and it has that little logo. One thing you'll notice though about Sora 2 right now is that the first like millisecond will be your source image. Right now, there's just not great support for this, but I imagine that will be fixed very, very soon. But you can see there's the original image and then there's the product appearing in the video. So it's like pretty much the exact same. One other thing that you may notice is if you want to do image to video with Sora 2, you can't have it be a person in the image. It will basically tell you we can't do this because it's a realistic looking person. even if that person is AI generated, unlike V3 where you could give it an AI generated person holding your product in case you wanted that to be like your brand ambassador on all of your videos and then V3 could take that image of the person holding the product and turn that into a video and that would help you sort of like leaprog over the issue with the first millisecond being the source image, but that's very easy to crop out. But anyways, I think that those UGC content use cases are super cool because you could basically just keep generating those and it will be a new person every time and it will look and feel very real and it will look good for your brand. And once again, that would only get better if you actually prompted it with best practices. Okay, so this next thing is really cool. This is using cameos, which basically means you can use famous people's faces and likeness in your videos. So on the Soru app, it's kind of, you know, like a social feed and people have profiles. So, if I went here and I searched Sam A, this is going to pull up Sam Alman's profile. And you can see here in his profile, if I go to cameos, we can see all of the times that people have made videos with Sam in them. And all we have to do to use Sam's cameo because he made it publicly accessible to people is we just copy his username, which is Sam A. So, in our Cameo example here, I have Sam A recording a selfie style video in a car explaining how Gravity works in two short sentences. So, let's go ahead and run this one. And it's going to do the same polling flow and everything like that. Keep in mind you can also use cameos in your um image to video generations as well. Right now I'm just doing a text to video to keep it simple. But one thing you may notice with cameos is Sora 2 may be a little bit more restrictive. So I tried doing some crazier prompts or I tried throwing in some other cameos like Shaq and Mark Human and it was kind of rejecting my prompts. So it just may be a little bit sensitive especially right now especially with so many people using cameos and using Sora 2. So just keep that in mind. Anyways, I will check in with you guys once this is done polling and once our video has been generated. All right, looks like we got that done. I'm going to go ahead and download this video and we'll see what Sam has to say for us. So, here we go. >> Everything with mass pulls on everything else. That pull makes things fall toward Earth. >> Okay, that was kind of ridiculous, but looked like him, sounded like him. we maybe just would want to prompt that a little bit better so he doesn't sound like he wants to die because I literally just said a selfie style video in a car explaining how gravity works in two short sentences. And what's cool is you can go ahead and create an account on Sora and you know do the process of setting up your own cameo and then you could use that in your automations. So you can have you know an avatar of yourself on your social media and you can just generate all these videos. So very cool stuff. All right, so now let's look at another really cool feature which is the storyboards. And to explain how this works, I'm real quick going to actually switch back to KAI and we're going to click on right here Sora 2 Pro storyboard. And for those of you wondering, we see Sora 2 text to video, Sora 2 Pro text to video. Honestly, I haven't seen a huge difference. And for the cost, how cheap Sora 2 regular is on KAI, I would just stick with this for now. But if maybe you do start to scale up the system and you want all of your content going out on Tik Tok or Instagram and you want to use Pro, then go for Pro. But anyways, for the storyboard, how this works is you're able to set different scenes. And like I said, you can have consistent characters within those scenes. And you're able to allocate a different amount of time per scene as long as it adds up to the total duration, which you can choose between 10, 15, or 25. But as you can see, it has to allocate correctly across the three scenes. So anyways, what I would do is I would go ahead and copy the request example once again like you guys saw in the demo. And what I did here was I set this up so you guys could basically put in an image URL. And then you could have three different scenes. So this image, as you can see, is an AI generated image of a curious, adventurous frog. And then our three scenes are basically that frog finding treasure and jumping around in the forest. So we're going to go ahead and run this. I will say I have sometimes had a 500 internal server error from key when I've been trying to do these storyboards, but we're going to go ahead and give it a try. So I'll execute the workflow. It's going to run our prompts through this request. It's going to go ahead and do the polling feature. And I will also say when I've done storyboards in the past, it's taken anywhere from like 500 to 700 seconds rather than just like, you know, your typical 180 to 250. So, this one may take a little bit longer, but I'll just check in with you guys and see if it worked or not. All right. So, while this one's running, I thought it would be a good opportunity to just talk about prompting because this has taken 740 seconds and I've just been sitting here staring at it and I'm getting bored. So, let's talk about prompting a little bit. So, there are people right now that are making a lot of money by going into like marketing departments and teaching them how to prompt Nanobanana, which is one of Google's image generation models and things like Sora 2 or Google V3. Because if you understand how to prompt these things and you can make high quality like UGC ads or VFX ads or scenes for movies and TV, whatever it is, there's a lot of money in that space because it costs so much money to get drones out there or have all the mics and you have to make sure the weather's correct when you're doing all of this in real life. And so, if you can just generate these scenes with good prompting, like I said, it's a really, really cool opportunity. So, I'm not a prompting expert when it comes to these creative generation models, but what I do know is there are certain things that you want to have in your video prompts. So, here is a very very basic highle prompt that I have for this AI agent that's going to take our raw input, optimize it, and then shoot it off to Sora 2. So, I'm sort of going to skim over this, but you guys will be able to access this for free when you download the free template. And so what I have here is you are an expert AI video prompt engineer trained to design optimized prompts for Sora 2. Your role is to take a raw input concept and transform it into a highly detailed video prompt. So this agent needs to always describe the main subject like appearance, clothing, age, gender, expression, and motion. The setting, so what's the location, what's in the background, what's the lighting like? What's the time of day? All this kind of stuff. The camera style, so the angle, the lens, the type of video, if there's any camera movement, all of that stuff really matters. The idea is that the prompt should sound like a professional cinematographer describing a shot to an actual like visual effects team. So anyways, this agent will take a raw input and transform it. So what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to stop this generation because we will be able to check on that in our key dashboard right here. You can see this one is still running. And what I'm going to do is drag this down here and run this one. And so if you remember what we did earlier with our texttov video prompt which was up here we had the one of the professor saying to its students that sor 2 is available on key. We have that exact same system prompt. So this is the exact same raw input that we gave earlier. And now what we're having the agent do is take that raw input and make it better and optimized for sore 2. So you can see now we get this huge input. We get a lively cinematic classroom shot as a sequence of natural documentary style coverage that highlights a charismatic professor and the engaged students. We've got a wide shot which is 24 mm tripod dolly. We later have medium twoshot which is 35mm gentle handheld. We've got a different type of reaction cutins with 50 mm. We've got the um quote right here. We have lip sync. We have all of this kind of stuff. It even gives us the overall tone, directorial notes, all of this stuff. So now what's happening is that got sent off to Sora 2 as you can see and it tells us that once again it's generating this message and so I'll check in with you guys when this one has been completed and we'll compare it to that video that we had earlier. All right, so this one finished up. It was a bigger prompt so it took a little longer. It took about 300 seconds. So first let's watch the original one that had no prompting, just the raw input. >> And here's the exciting part. Sora 2 is now available on Kai AI making it easier than ever to create stunning videos. >> You can experiment, iterate, and bring your wildest ideas to life. Okay, nice. So, that's still not bad, right? But look at this one. Because we had the best practices of prompting worked in, >> Sora 2 is now available on KA AI, making it easier than ever to create stunning videos. All right, so I hope you could tell that the second one felt a lot more cinematic and there was different shots and there was like different scenes going on in there. So, I just thought that that's pretty cool. And once again, the idea is all you have to do is give it the raw input and then the AI agent that you prompt to specialize in making it into a video prompt is going to take care of that for you. And so, yes, it's nice that we have kind of like a highlevel here are some good practices for prompting. But what you would do is when you have your specific use case, like let's say it's your UGC ads, on top of giving it just these basic rules, you would come in here and really tailor this towards specifically UGC content video prompting. And as you refine that prompt and make it better and better, your outputs are just going to get better and better as well. So, for example, and just to sort of hint at a future video that may be coming, you could have a Google sheet like this where you have a product photo of your own product, you have just the ICP, you have the features of the product, and you have a video setting, and that's all you have to give it. And then your AI agents in NN could take all of that and make the optimized script, make the optimized video prompt, and then you're just getting all of these UGC content videos pumped out automatically because you could have 10 coming out a day, 10 coming out an hour, however many you want. Okay, so the storyboard video that we generated together live here, it took 35 minutes, but it did finish up. So, let's go ahead and give it a quick watch. Okay. So, that's pretty funny. You can see what it did though is it was able to use our image URL that we provided right here. So, this is the character that we wanted it to be and it was consistent throughout the three scenes. it would now just be a matter of making these prompts a little bit better because all of these prompts had, you know, not really the elements that we discussed as far as lighting, background, camera movement, camera style, all that kind of stuff. But hopefully now you can just get a sense of how those storyboards work and how you can control the scenes and timing to create some consistent character videos. The final thing I want to talk about here is doing some data cleanup. So something that you guys didn't see that happened in this step up here was our AI agent output this prompt with new lines. So we had new lines and then also down here you can see we had double quotation marks and both new lines and double quotes will break the JSON body request. So as a best practice you can use these expressions which I'll show you guys in a sec in your request to Sora 2. So in this body request you can see I don't just have the output. Let me actually just delete this real quick. So this is the output of the agent and on the right hand side is the result. So you can see there's new lines here which would break this. And then also we have our wherever they are somewhere down here. Right here we have the double quotes. Sor 2 is now available on KI. And so when we put in this little expression, it's basically replacing those new lines. As you can see, they got chopped off. And I'm not going to be able to find it again now, but the double quotes would have been removed as well. And that's how you make sure no matter what your AI agent outputs, because sometimes they'll throw in new lines and double quotes even if you prompt them not to, you can basically get rid of that no matter what. And so what I wanted to show real quick is if I run this setup down here, so you guys can kind of just isolate those variables and look at it. We have right here we have new lines. So this is line one, this is line two, this is line three, and then we have another text over here with double quotes that says pizza pizza. And if we run this second one, we have the replace function up here to get rid of new lines. And then we have the replace function here to get rid of the double quotes. And now you can see on the right hand side they're both coming out completely clean. So that's how those replace function works. And then you can basically just copy these and save them. So whenever you need to use that replace you've got it right here. The last thing I wanted to talk about is errors. When you're maybe getting a failure in your sore video generations. So here are some failures that I got. You can see all of these have error code 500 which means there's something internally going on and that's why it errored. And by internally I mean on the key or sor 2 on the server side of things. So, this could mean that they're getting way too many requests and there's just an issue. It could mean that AWS blacked out and they're down or something like that. But it could also mean that your content is being restricted because maybe you put something in there that is automatically getting flagged and they're just basically rejecting you. So, here's an example of a Sor 2 Pro storyboard that I did and you can see it got rejected. Internal error. I'm not exactly sure why. But then here's another Soru storyboard that I did and it was successful and this one took um almost 7 minutes. So, this was the highle video of different ways that you can use sore 2. If you guys have some specific use cases that you'd want to see me build an automation for or certain agents for, then definitely let me know down below. I'd love to bring some more Sor 2 and some VO 3.1 content for you guys cuz I think this creative AI space is super cool. And once again, you guys can download this entire template and get all of this stuff so you can play around for completely free. All you have to do is join my free school community. The link for that is down in the description. When you join this free school community, all you have to do to find that is go to YouTube resources or search for the title of this video. And in that post associated with the video, you'll find the JSON right here. And you just have to download that JSON, import it into your NADN, and then this exact workflow will pop up. There will also be a setup guide over here that shows you like what you need to connect and all that kind of stuff. And if you're looking to dive deeper with AI automations and connect with over 200 members who are learning every day and building businesses with AI every day, then definitely check out my plus community. The link for that is also down in the description. Like I said, it's a super supportive community of members who are building businesses and sharing what they're learning. And we have three full courses. We have Agent Zero, which is the foundations of AI automation for beginners. We've got 10 hours to 10 seconds where you learn how to identify, design, and build time-saving automations. And then for our annual members, or if you've been with us for 6 months, we've got oneperson AI automation agency where we start to talk about how you can actually get in front of business owners and start to sell these solutions. On top of that, we also have one live Q&A per week where I get to just basically talk to you guys and have some pretty fun discussions. So, I'd love to see you guys in those calls. I would love to see you in these communities. But that's going to do it for today. So, if you enjoyed the video or you learned something new, please give it a like. It definitely helps me out a ton. And as always, I appreciate you guys making it to the end of the video. I'll see you on the next one. Thanks so much everyone."

You get access to all kinds of great perks, but probably the best in my opinion is to join my private Discord channel where we talk all things Creative AI. We'd love to see as many of you guys over there as possible. And without further ado, let's get straight into the video. So, for starters, I needed to come up with an idea for a business that I'm going to market. Now, I'm originally from a very small town down in southern England. There's not a lot going on there at all, but one of my favorite things and something I really do miss is their local bakery. This bakery has been around forever now. It's a very small familyrun independent bakery. And that was kind of my jumping off point. I didn't really want to base this whole video around some really extravagant or expensive idea like a multi-million dollar tech startup company or something like that. Let's keep it relatable. So, this bakery from my hometown, it sells all sorts of amazing things, but my favorite item on their shelves was their cheese straws. These amazing delicious cheesy puff pastries that were just I couldn't get enough of them. When I think of comfort food, cheese straws from that specific bakery is the first thing that pops into my head. So, I thought it'd be cool to take that concept and I would set up my own independent bakery that only sells cheese straws. And we're kind of going off the same business model as Supernova Burger. If you guys don't know, this is a viral burger joint which is in Soho. And they're very well known for just having a very small menu. Literally just like a few burgers, chips, couple of milkshakes, that's it. But because their menu is so small, the quality of the items that you get are really high. And of course, when the customer goes there, they know exactly what they're going to get. And it's that same business model that we're applying to our cheese straw bakery. This idea of simplicity in design and the menu resulting in a premium product. And of course, if it ended up going viral on social media, that's just a bonus, right? So, with that, we started to piece together our brand. We know it's going to be a small hipster style bakery that sells premium cheese straws. It follows the same business model as Supernova. There's going to be three cheese straw types. A normal one, which is called the purest, veggie, which is called the veggie, and a meaty one called the butcher. We're also going to serve three dips. So, whenever you buy cheese straws, you're going to get a choice of one dip to go with them. You're going to have caramelized onion chutney, garlic and herbioli, and spicy tomato relish. And of course, to keep those hipsters happy, we're going to have to sell some craft coffee, which is roasted in small batches as well. So you can see we've got a definite vibe going on here, right? We're thinking of our audience and we're seeing how our brand is going to factor into every kind of facet of the business. And one of the most important parts of coming up with a brand is the name. And I threw all sorts of ideas around, but eventually I landed on Puff. It's really simple. It feels kind of hipster with the full stop at the end. It's quite memorable. It's a little bit kind of strange, so it might stick in your mind. And of course, it's relevant to the product because you make these cheese straws using puff pastry. So, the next step was to go ahead and design our logo. So, for this, I just used Canva. You can see over here what I got up to. This is my general process I always use whenever I'm trying to come up with a brand. We'd already decided on the name, obviously, so I just typed out Puff lots of times and used up lots of different fonts that I liked. And essentially what we do is just slowly whittle them down by deleting the ones that we don't like as much. So the last two options were these two here. I really liked both of them. It was a hard decision, but I settled for this. I felt this was very clean and premium. And of course, we've gone for this very simple color palette of this pastel pink in the background and white. So the text is nice and legible. And you might be thinking, if it's cheese straws, why did you not go for yellow? I just felt it was a little bit obvious and we're trying to do things to make our business stand out and maybe feel a little bit irregular. Anything that can make your brand feel a bit more memorable is worth doing in my book. And I don't know, I just liked these two colors together. It just feels right to me. Canva itself is a really great free resource. There are paid versions of it, but I just use it for free and I use it all of the time. It has got less tools than Photoshop. you can't really do advanced compositing to my knowledge. But when it comes to things like this, which is kind of simple graphic design, I think Canva really shines. You can see as well that I started to put together a whole load of references to kind of inspire me like a shop exterior here. We also have the inside of a very rustic bakery. Star of the show, the cheese straw itself. I mean, there's loads of different ways to make these. Lots of different flavors as we've touched on. And I just think it's really handy to get together lots of different images just to lead you down a certain path. So of course things are really starting to come together now. We've got a very strong concept for our bakery. We've got the logo here as well with the color scheme. And now it's time to think about how we can use AI to really create a very premium feeling ad. So really here we're talking about AI film making. And as I always say, all of the best AI videos stem from a single starting frame. An AI image, which does a really good job of capturing a certain character or style. These first steps that we're going to take are really, really important for laying the groundwork, the foundation of everything else that's going to branch off from them. So, at this stage, we're starting to think of some key visuals for our brand. And these can be both used for print campaigns, so just normal images, as well as moving images, which we can put together to form our advert or commercial if you're American. We need to think about what shots we need to tell a story. Now, if you've got an existing business, you can again kind of skip this step and just go ahead and take your own photos really. If you've already got a shop and you've already got a product, you don't necessarily need to use AI at this point. Although you'll see that you can take those existing images and feed them into my process very shortly. So just because you've already got existing assets for your business doesn't mean that AI can't help you to use them in a variety of different ways. And you'll see that very shortly. So one of the first shots I knew that we needed was an exterior shot of the bakery itself. And I found this image here of Fortitude Bake House that I really liked and wanted to use as some inspiration. So I fed that into chat GPT and I said, ""I want you to write me a midjourney prompt to recreate this image."" Remove the signage from the window and change the blue color to a soft pink. Also expand a little to show more of the street it's on. Think a trendy area of London like Shortitch. Keep the pink shop as the focal point and central in frame. and make sure my prompt finishes with photoreal, ultradetailed textures, cinematic composition, harsh shadows, analog photography. And I really love using an LLM like chat GPT, Grock, or Gemini for this use case cuz I can struggle to describe even quite a basic image. But this for me is where a tool like chat GPT really shines cuz it just instantly gives you this prompt. I think I went ahead and made just a couple of light tweaks to this, but of course we took it over to Midjourney, my personal favorite AI image generator. Now, originally I did use the Fortitude Bake House, dropping that in as a style reference, but unfortunately it kind of screwed up my prompt and we lost the pink. In a way, this really does show you how great Chat GPT is at writing prompts because I did away with the style reference. Just whacked the text prompt right into MidJourney and we got back some amazing results. All of these are great in different ways to be honest with you. I really liked a lot of them. Did a really great job of creating these images for me, but I believe we ended up going with this one here. I kind of liked how it wasn't perfect. I think with AI images and videos, you want to try and find that human element or just like the imperfection in even like objects and settings just to try and sell the realism that little bit more. And as we proceed up here, I knew as well a very key visual was going to be the product itself. So I ended up wanting to use Midjourney to create myself some cheese straws. Again, we're really laying into that pastel pink theme. Obviously, the shop itself is pastel pink. And then all of these shots of the product, I wanted them to be pastel pink as well. We're wrapping the cheese straws in this pastel pink paper. And you can see sometimes trial and error. You guys know what AI is like. We've got some sort of cheesy for catcher here, which does look delicious, but it's not a cheese straw. Quite a few of the generations I got back were just not right. A lot of them sort of look more like cheesy quason to be honest with you. However, this one here looked really, really great. So, we went ahead and downloaded this. Love the way that MidJourney even made this woman's nails pink. Very consistent theme going on we got here. And one of the great things about AI is being able to put yourself into any scene you really can imagine. So, of course, I wanted to have a bit of fun and put me in this ad and also within the setting of the bakery. So, I went ahead and made a few different variations of portraits. Again, obviously with me up against this pastel pink background. If you guys want to know how to recreate yourself accurately using tools like MidJourney or any AI image generator really, you can go ahead and check out the video on the screen right now. There's a lot more detail there if you really want to dive into it, but it's really all to do with using your prompt and also making sure to upload a good highquality selfie and then putting that into the omni reference section of midjourney. And I set my omni reference strength to about 125. One here of me eating the cheese straw. Not sure if that's going to make it in the final ad. We will see. Now, MidJourney is a paid tool, but personally, I think it is well worth it. You can do the cheapest plan, I think, for something like $10 a month. And the results you get from this thing are incredible in my book. But I'm always looking for ways to do things on a budget because I'm aware a lot of you guys might not have an awful lot of money to be thrown around, especially if you're trying to start up a business from the ground up. So really, these starting images that we have technically paid for from midjourney, we're going to kind of cut that off now and we're going to go down a free route. You take these and repurpose them. And of course to do this we're going to be using Nano Banana which is an amazing AI image generator that's just been released by Google. So you can see here I put in my image that we created with Midjourney of the exterior of my Puff Bakery. And I said to Nano Banana, ""Show me the interior of this bakery. A wide angle view of a stylish bakery interior with a clean, modern design. White tiled walls and wooden tables filled with fresh cheese straws. Vibrant potted plants and hanging plants bring life and greenery into the space, adding a touch of shortorditch charm. A minimal pastel pink menu is displayed on the tiled wall above the counter. Simple and elegant. Staff in pastel pink aprons work behind the counter while customers move through the space motion blurred and dynamic adding energy without distracting from the design. The wide-angle perspective captures the openness and depth of the bakery emphasizing its artistic modern and inviting atmosphere. And of course I always put this bit on the end here about photore ultradetailed textures cinematic composition harsh shadows analog photography. So, this would have been an output from chat GPT as well. You could just tell that this was written by an LLM, but I just went in and made a few tweaks as I always do. And I want you to just keep in mind, we have just thrown this image here at Nano Banana. And what we get back is this. It feels consistent and it feels realistic as well. I'm not actually sure if we ended up using this image, but it's a really great example of how you can use Nano Banana. And if we scroll down a little bit more, you can see that I said, ""Show me a closeup of a well manicured man's hand holding a plain pastel pink takeaway coffee cup that matches the aesthetic of the shop exterior. Make it feel stylish and premium."" And what we get back is this. The soft focus background is literally our starting image. Like how insane is that? Now right here I am using Nano Banana through LM Arena. If you want to access it in this way, you literally just type into Google LMA. And this is how I usually tend to use Nano Banana just because you get your outputs without the little Gemini logo in the bottom right hand corner and it can be a little bit annoying to remove them. Of course, we don't want any watermarks on our images if we're then going to go on to animate them, right? But I do want to show you why you might want to use Nano Banana directly through Gemini as well. So, here I am accessing Gemini for free through my web browser. And the great thing about using it this way, yes, you're going to get your watermark, but you can combine more than one image. So, first I put in my logo which we designed with Canva and then I put in the image that we just generated with Nano Banana through LM arena of the coffee cup and we can say put the logo that reads puff on the coffee cup and just look at the result that we get back. You'll notice however that it's given us back a one by one aspect ratio and this is a question I get a lot in my comments. Why is Nano Banana giving me back square images? Essentially, the aspect ratio of the image you input into Nano Banana is what you're going to get back. But if you're using multiple images, the last image you input is what aspect ratio you're going to get back. So the order essentially that you upload your images matters. If you look at our logo, it's 1x one, right? But if you look at our shot of the coffee cup, it's 16 by9. So, we want to put in our logo first and then our 16x9 image. And because we're putting in the horizontal image last, that is what we're going to get back from Nano Banana. And you can see it does a really great job of comping on the shadows, the logo, everything just looks great. Before you would have had to like go into Photoshop and mess around with blending modes and all of that stuff, do a little bit of masking to even bring the thumb back over the top. But don't worry about it. Nano Banana will sort all of that for you. You can see as well here that I put in a different shot of the interior, which I really liked. But I did kind of think, why would the cheese straws be on these tables? So once again, you can feed that into Nano Banana and say, ""Make the tables clear and put the cheese straws on the counter behind a pane of glass."" And what we get back is this. We are really starting to construct our business from the ground up with AI. Insane. Another great example here. We're back on Ella Marina. I tend to switch between the two ways to access Nano Banana, which I prefer. You can access it through all sorts of paid subscriptions as well. or I think Freepick and Higsfield, loads of different sites do it, but these ways you can access the tool for free. So, I put in this image of our interior and I gave it the prompt, a bakery worker with his back to the camera arranging shelves stacked full of freshly baked cheese straws, golden brown with crisp. The shelves are wooden and the walls are white tile. The worker is seen from behind midaction reaching up to place a cheese straw on the shelf wearing a casual pastel pink long-sleeved t-shirt. The scene is warm, artisal, and authentic with a vibrant atmosphere that captures the charm of a busy urban bakery. Now, I didn't even clock this until now, but we asked for a man. What we got was a woman. However, this generation is so good. And again, we can take this over to Gemini, put our logo in first, our one by one image, then put in this shot of the woman arranging the shelves, and ask it to put the logo on the back of her shirt. And we get this back. Let me open it up for you again so you can see in detail. So, essentially, we're using Nano Banana almost like a worldbuing tool. We started off with these key visuals and we're continually branching off away from that, creating more and more different shots. We're building out our brand and we're establishing the physical space as well. And some more amazing examples here. So, I put in the portrait of myself that I made with MidJourney, and I put in my exterior shot that we also made with Midjourney, and I said midshot of the bearded man leaning up against the outside of the shop, arms folded, looking confidently at the camera. And what we got back was this. Now, I'm not really leaning up against the shop, but still, look how convincing that is. Another great example as well. We've put in the interior of the bakery and put in the portrait of me. And we said to Nano Banana, ""Shot of the bearded man. He's wearing a pastel pink apron and stood behind the counter smiling at a trendy customer and handing them a cheese straw wrapped in pastel pink paper bag."" And what we got back was this shot as well. Now, once again, I'm not behind the counter like I asked, but this still functions as a really great shot that we can use within our advert. You can see here as well back on Ella Marina also still using Nano Banana. Put in the exterior shot and I've said low angle show a trendy man walking around the shop with his back to the camera. We can see him carrying a freshly baked cheese straw wrapped in a plain pastel pink carrier bag. We got back this. Eventually, I did a few different reworks of this cuz the results were a bit strange. I wanted him to just remove the cheese straws in the end from the equation, and we got back this really nice shot as well. You can see your imagination really is the limit. Let's go ahead and just do a quick example together. Now guys, so I'm just going to drop in the image that we made of the bakery interior and I'm going to say, ""Show me an attractive female staff member making a fresh coffee with an expensive coffee machine for a customer. She is wearing a pastel pink apron and the coffee is in a pastel pink takeaway cup. Let's send that off and see what we get back. You can see we got a little error there which is a little bit annoying. So, let's just go ahead and make a new chat. That can really help you out sometimes if you're getting some weird errors. So, we'll just drop our image back in and rewrite our prompt. All right. And let's hit return on this one and see what we get back. I definitely do find that Nano Banana can be a little bit buggy. So, that's a nice little hack of just starting a new chat. Whether you're using it through LM Marina or Gemini, sometimes it just gets a little confused and you need to just set the record straight. And again, just look at this. Look at how good this is. It's got a little confused about the geography of the space, I would say, but it looks consistent in terms of style, right? And of course, how is Nano Banana to know about the layout of our imaginary bakery? Let's just hit rerun again and see what we get on a second attempt. Yeah. So, here we go. I like this a lot more. It still feels consistent with our style and our physical space. We've got our nice pastel pink menu over here on the left hand side. slightly different coffee cup to what we had earlier, but you could imagine that maybe because it's a larger coffee than that first shot, maybe it's a slightly different type of coffee cup. So, it's really not the end of the world. But everything else here looks great to me. So, we can just go ahead and get that downloaded for completely free. Once you've got your key visuals, whether you created them with AI or whether you took images yourself with your phone or a proper DSLR camera, you can use a tool like Nano Banana to essentially flesh out your brand or flesh out the kind of storytelling or world that you're building. Your imagination really is the limit with a tool like this. I really do mean that. As long as you're putting in clear prompts, you're going to get back some insane results here that don't just look cool, they'll actually be functional in a real advert. And after messing around for a while, we get back some really great images which serve as our key visuals for our campaign. Always thinking about what shots we might need to tell our story. And another great example here, we have the cheese straws that Midjourney created for us. I would have fed this into Nano Banana and asked to see the cheese straw being torn apart. And this is what we got back. Crazy. So, at this point, we've got all of these different still frame images. We've got our logo. We've essentially built up our stills or print campaign. But now that we have those starting frames, we can go ahead and start looking at animating them. Of course, this is what's really going to start to bring our projects to life. And as always, I'm going to show you the free tool that I often use to animate my AI videos. Before we get into that, guys, if you are enjoying today's content, make sure to whack a like on there for me, consider subscribing if you're new, and of course, ring that bell notification icon. So, if we head over to Flex Clip, the guys over there were very kind enough to give me a bunch of credits to check out their platform, and it's pretty handy because it has image to video, text to video, and I believe we've also got image generators here as well. The cool thing about Flex Clip is if you go up here to model, you can actually pick from Cling, and you can pick from Hilu as well. So, you've got a fair few different options built into the tool already. But you can see here from my history, if we put in the image of the cheese straw being torn apart, which I think I just showed you guys, my prompt was slow dolly camera move forward as the hands pull apart the cheese straw. Steam rising, cheese oozing, soft puff pastry tumbling out of frame ASMR style. And this is what we got back. And it looks insanely real. The way that cheese behaves, the way the steam moves. Yeah. Wow. You can see here as well the model used was Cling, which is one of my favorite AI video generation models, I have to say. So, as I'm sure you guys can tell, the process at this stage is just continually run through and animate our AI images using a variety of different video generators. This is the one that I just showed you guys over from Flex Clip. Another great one here of me stood outside the shop. Super realistic movement and everything. Love it. and we are just continually building up our world. Quite a cool helpful way to think about it as as if you are a filmmaker trying to make a documentary. So, you're just capturing all these different shots on the fly and you're thinking in your head, what do I need to give my editor to be able to construct a story? That's essentially what we're doing here with AI. let's just put together as many different videos as we can to build up this brand and then it's up to the editor, which happens to also be us, uh, to piece these blocks together and to build out a story and a brand. Now, of course, I promised you guys I would show you a free way to animate your AI images as well. If you're a fan of my videos, you've been watching me for a little while now, I'm going to be like a broken record, but you guys know how much I love LM Arena, particularly using the Discord. So, I'm going to put a link to LM Marina's Discord down below in the comments section because it is an amazing free tool. So, annoyingly, it turns out currently Marina is actually down, but it's super simple to use. This is the first time I've actually seen it down. I've been using it for months now. All you do is you input one of your AI images. So, we've got a whole bunch of those, of course, that we can use here. For instance, we could drop in this image of our staff member who's filling out the shelves. You just drop in your text prompt and you are going to get back a AI video from some of the best models out there. Now, is a lucky dip. It basically gives you back two different generations from random models. So, you'll get back some good results. You'll also get back some pretty rubbish results as well. But if I go ahead and show you this really nice shot here of the coffee cup came directly from Ella Marina as you're going to see in a second with the little plug at the end of the outputs you'll receive from the Discord. If you do want to use this for your content creation or the advert that you're piecing together, you can just cut this end card off using some editing. Drop it into Premiere Pro, Da Vinci Resolve, Cap Cut, anything like that and just chop the end off. Simple as that. annoying that I can't show you guys right now how I would do that properly, but usually the Elearina, Discord, the video arenas, they work really, really well. Uh, but just at the minute, they seem to be bugged. I'm sure they'll fix it very quickly and then you guys will be able to maybe even after you've watched this video, it's been fixed. Go ahead and create some AI videos for free. So guys, I really do hope that this video has helped you out. If you're a small business owner and you wanted to know how you can use AI to build up an entire advert for yourself, we've covered a whole range of tools and tips and tricks. As always, if you do have any questions at all, be sure to put them down below in the comment section. I'll do my absolute best to reply to as many as I possibly can. Remember, of course, that we have just launched memberships on this channel as well. So, if you would like another way to support me, you're very welcome to get involved with that. Like I said, you'll get access to our private Discord server where we can share all sorts of amazing ideas about how to use AI for creative means. Thank you so much as always for watching people.

You sit down, you record a video, and then it takes you three hours to edit it. You're cutting out every um or every pause by hand, splitting, splicing, and it takes hours. And then you're fighting with audio that sounds like you recorded it in a wind tunnel. And you're trying to figure out why your timeline looks like an absolute disaster, and you can't figure out where that sound effect is coming from because it's completely buried in the multiple layers you have in the timeline. Most video editing software assumes that you're a professional video editor, but maybe you just want to create content without needing a film degree. So, I actually want to dive into five different AI video editing tricks that will give you so much time back by automatically doing the tedious things for you so that you can focus on content creation and not spend hours inside of video editing software. And of course, I'm going to show you how to do all of this inside of my favorite video editing software, Descript, who is the sponsor of today's video. You all know that I create a lot of video content. And if you're new around here, hi. I create a lot of video content. And I absolutely used to dread the video editing process. But now, I let Descript's AI tools handle a lot of those tedious processes for me. And I'm not talking about just basic stuff. I'm talking about things that absolutely change your entire workflow by saving you hours of time. And I can promise you, these AI features are not going to take away your creativity. It is simply going to give you time back so that you can inject more of your creativity into your workflow. You will have the time, the free space, the energy to actually focus on content creation and not content editing. So, let's get right into it. This very first feature is what drew my attention to the script years and years and years ago. And it is AI transcription and textbased editing, which is just a fancy way of saying that it's going to automate a transcription for me. And then I can use that transcription and I can edit my videos like I would any kind of word-based document. So instead of scrubbing through timelines and splicing and clipping, I can literally just highlight a piece of text, delete it, and it's removed from my video. Or I can copy, paste, I can cut, I can strike through. Basically, anything that I can do inside of that editing tool, I can do into script and it will reflect in my video. This alone saves me hours in my video editing process. Let me show you how it works. Okay, so the very first part of this video that you already watched is actually right here. So, anything that you see in blue is actually my writing. You can come up and use this write tool. Again, this is why I love this textbased editor. This was my script for my intro that I had off to the side. And then anything that I actually put into Descript to be edited lives right here. Now, there are two different ways that you can add your video content into the script. Personally, my favorite is coming right into the tool, hitting record, and I record directly in the platform. And this allows that AI textbased transcription to automatically populate as it is rendering and processing. So, it just saves me a step or two or three of not having to transfer things off of my camera from memory card to memory card to this that. No exporting, no importing. Now, this textbased transcript will also work if you import clips. And it's as easy as coming over to the project tab, adding your files, dragging and dropping it in here. So, basically the way that I approach video editing is now I can actually see in a very visible way like what I said in that video. So, you can see I obviously wanted to say this and I had to at the beginning of the video say it quite a few different times. So, what I can do is I can come in here and I can simply hit delete and it will be removed from the video for me. So instead of there is still a timeline based editor. Instead of having to come down here and like try and find where I said what and hit split and hit split and hit delete and all these different things, I can now just do that inside of the transcript. If you don't want things to be as like concrete, you can also just come up here and click the strike through and that will remove it. You saw it kind of remove it from the timeline, but it hasn't completely disappeared. so that in case you do want to actually have what you said there, you can just come back and unstrike it. It works similarly for anything else like that you would do in a word-based document. You can like highlight this, you can cut it, and let's say you want this at the beginning of the video, paste it there, and it automatically moves it around for you. So again, this just makes it so much easier for me to visually see and do a very quick rough draft edit without me having to, you know, come down to the timeline and try and click and splice and move things around and it's a lot more complicated. Plus, this transcript at the end, just quick little bonus tip here, you can export the transcript as a text file. You can export it as any type of document. And then I personally like to reuse this transcript. I put it into my AI tools and I use it to help me repurpose all of this content or help me optimize whatever piece of content I have. So obviously this is a YouTube video. I can plug this entire transcript into my AI tools and it helps me optimize it for YouTube as well. So that's just a little bonus tip in how I use some of these AI features inside of Descript for this textbased style editing. So, we all have natural pauses when we speak and this next AI based tool inside of Descript is actually going to help the flow of your video because sometimes those pauses are just a bit too long. And overall, we don't want the video to feel too fast-paced or too slow so that we're always keeping our audience watching for the duration of the video. So, I use Descript's shorten word gap feature for every piece of video content that I put into this tool, and it's really helpful, especially for these longer form videos when I might be referencing an outline, I might be referencing a script, or I just take a minute to breathe. It will remove all that dead space for me. And then for like my shorter form content, I still lean into this tool because our attention spans are very short. In the nature of short form content, we want to get rid of those millennial pauses, which I am very, very guilty of. And we want to condense as many of those gaps as possible so that we keep people watching for longer. So let me show you how you can use this feature and quickly remove all that dead space in your video with one click of a button. Okay. So again, I'm going to quickly use the example that you guys have already watched this exact video. So what I will do is I have my shortened word gap already set up uh for the pacing that I like. But you simply come over into the AI tools. You click on shorten word gaps. And for me, I really really like to condense my gaps. So I have any gap that is bigger than.1 second. It shortens it to 0.1 second. And you can see I do that 131 times in this video and it's not very long at all. I'm actually actively still recording this video. So I'm not even done. But you can see right here, anytime you see these flat lines, these bigger gaps, it is going to get rid of that in my entire video. So, I'll show you quickly what this looks like. You can see there's dead space here. There's 4 seconds of dead space, 1 second of dead space, 2 seconds. But when I click shorten all, it removed every single one of those gaps 131 times just in this shorter video, and it did it for me. Whereas I used to in traditional timeline based video editing, you would have to come down here and like really zoom into this and see where that like flatline starts. You would come in here, splice, and then you'd have to search for that end part. Come over here, slice, and then you can come in here and delete that clip. Now, imagine having to do that 131 times. That's what I did in this video. That takes a lot of time and energy. So, this tool, again, feel free to adjust your settings. These are the ones that I prefer because again I want to shorten and condense all of my breathing and pauses and everything like that as much as possible. But this saves I would argue at least an hour alone. So now that we've already removed all of the pauses, there are a few other AI based tools inside of your script that's really going to help you with that first round kind of rough cut of your video. And these are also just as time-saving as removing and shortening those word gaps. And again, this is the stuff that doesn't replace your creativity. It essentially just gets rid of those really tedious and very annoying almost I I like to call them like the admin tasks of video editing that literally nobody wants to do so that it will free up your time. That way you can apply more of the creative edits that you want to do. You can do cooler transitions. You can add better B-roll. You can do things throughout your video content creation to make that video more engaging by reducing the amount of time you spend on like these backend really terrible terrible parts of the video editing process. So, the first one that I want to show you is you come back into that AI tool panel. And the first thing that I want to show you, which this is a godsend for somebody like me, I love saying the word um and I love saying the word like. I tend to use those the most as filler words for when I'm searching for the right word to say next. So, I'll come over into descript and click on this remove filler words. Now, again, this is a much shorter video, but if you have like a lengthy podcast interview or you have a longer form YouTube piece of content, you can actually just remove all the likes, the ums, any type of filler word. So, you can actually just trust the AI tool and click remove all. Or what you can do is come over into this panel here. And you notice that there is a word that you're like, I do actually want to keep that in. So, let's say it's right here. I want to skip that one. And you can actually also see it highlighted in the transcript over here. All of these that are highlighted in yellow. But once you come through and you're like, okay, I want to skip this one. I skip this one. Then you can click remove all and it will remove it for you, which again is just a huge timesaver if you tend to use a lot of those filler words. Now, you might want to keep some in here or there. For me, the big one that it'll recognize as like a filler word is when I like, you know, you know, you know, those I tend to leave in. But just know that you can use this tool to just like kind of get rid of some of the things that you don't want to say all the time. As you can see here, I tend to repeat myself or do multiple retakes, especially for like my YouTube intros where I have them pretty scripted or if I mess up while I'm recording in YouTube, I will use this remove retakes feature and click submit. And basically, it's going to run through my entire transcript and see where I you repeated myself and it'll keep the better take. So here you can see I did mess up quite a bit and then it found the better take for me. And you can either just leave this as is. It is already removed from the transcript for you. You can restore it if you're like I actually like that take better or you can completely delete it. But it'll also show to you over here. There's so many different options. But again, it just starts to streamline that editing process if you tend to have a lot of mess ups like me and need to kind of get rid of the ones that you don't want. And then this last one here, edit for clarity. I actually don't use all that often because I find that this tool works best if you are a podcaster or you have some kind of video that is over 30 minutes long. Basically, it will go through it's going to remove those filler words, any type of retakes, places where there are obvious cuts, but I find that if the video is too short, it just removes key information. But if you have a podcast and let's say your guest Wi-Fi cut out for five minutes in the middle, it'll also recognize that. So, I think this is more important for those longer form video-based podcasts, but it will refine your video and give you that first draft by editing it for clarity and flow. So, with those three features and also the one I talked about earlier, the shortened word gap, you now have a rough cut of your video in a matter of probably minutes. And these are things that would have taken you hours if you had done this through a traditional timeline editor. And this next feature is one that has saved me far too many times than I can count. And it's actually something that I use on every single video that I edit inside of Descript. And it's actually the studio sound feature. Now, because video is king, we still need to edit our videos, but if you have terrible audio quality, people are likely to swipe away. So using the studio sound feature, it's going to clean up all of the background noise. It's going to remove echo. And even with the professional microphone that I am using right now, it's a Blue Yeti mic and it is sitting on my desktop. It's like right here. I don't know if you you guys can't see it, but that's okay. I even use it when I am using professional equipment because I tend to This is a a desk stand. So, I will accidentally hit my desk and it will make loud booming noises. It will automatically remove all of that for me so that I don't have to go and re-record because my audio got messed up. This also works well if I'm out and about and I'm filming just with my phone. If I'm using my DJI with the small little mic that comes with it, that audio tends to still be kind of crappy and I use the studio sound feature to really just clean up that audio. So, first I want to show you how to access that feature and then I want to show you a few examples of it turned on and turned off with the different kind of mics that I have. So, this feature is actually very very simple to use, but does take a little bit of time depending upon how long your video is. It just takes some time for it to render, but again, still super super fast and very very accurate. So, you come back over into the AI tools panel, and you click on studio sound. So, you're going to see it's going to start to level out your audio. It's going to be applying that AI studio sound for you. And basically, what you can do is you can dial in how much of that effect that you want. So, you can toggle it on and off here, but you can also decrease the intensity. I tend to, if I'm using my Blue Yeti mic, I keep the intensity all the way at 100% because I just feel like it really keeps it crispy and clean. and the audio that you're currently listening to comes from the Blue Yeti mic along with the studio sound effect on here. And that way I just make sure that my YouTube content is as accessible in terms of audio as possible. Now, when I'm using stuff basically that I filmed with my phone or that I film with other cameras and other mics, sometimes I will play around with this intensity because if you have it dialed all the way up to 100%, it'll sound a little muffly and might sound a little weird. So, always feel free to play with the intensity of this effect. That's as easy as it is. Now your audio is nice and clean and it has been like background noises removed, no more echo, none of that garbage. Now, here are some quick examples of what this looks like in action. In order to engage your audience, you're going to need to add these four different things to your social media post. I would argue that my favorite pastime is actually repurposing video content. And now we can actually do it inside of Canva. It's a Blue Yeti mic and it is sitting on my desktop. I even use it when I am using professional equipment. So, the last four AI features that I showed you inside Descript are there to help speed up your video editing workflow as you are producing the original piece of content. Whether that is a short form video, a YouTube video, a video podcast, you're doing workshops, what whatever it is that you're editing inside of your script, those features are used to speed up that workflow of editing just that video. Now, I want to take it a step further, and this is arguably my most used feature inside of Descript. Those other four I use on every single video. Don't get me wrong, it is a part of that video editing process. But this next feature, well, I should say handful of features actually helped me take that video, that piece of content, and expand it beyond just that original piece. I use certain AI features inside of Descript to actually pull clips from that original video to go in multiple places across multiple marketing channels, across multiple social media channels, so that I can extend the shelf life of that video and also speed up my content creation process for other platforms as well. So, there are a few different ways that you can actually extract content from this video like once you're fully done editing it. And that way you can pull clips for other social media platforms. So, the first one I honestly will do this for vast majority of my content just cuz I know what's in my content. I can come over here. Let's say you loved what you said here. You would highlight the whole thing. You can rightclick duplicate to a new composition. And personally, I already have like a folder structure set up where I have a folder full of clips. So, I'm just going to click there. And basically what you're going to see up here is again I have a folder that I've added to my composition area. I could drop down. These are ones that I have already pulled for myself. But you can see this exactly what I just had here now is pulled into a new composition so that I can then edit this further and optimize it for social media. So you can continue doing that entire process throughout your YouTube video. So let's say you come across another section. Uh you would just highlight it, rightclick, duplicate to. You can add it to a new composition. You can add it to the clips folder. You can add it to a different folder. Or you can add it to any of the other compositions that you've already pulled. This is just a really manual way of repurposing that content. But if you kind of know what you've got in there and you're like, I know I said something fire around minute 325 and you're like, I know I want to pull that clip. So that's option one. Option two, you can actually come over into the AI tools panel and you can see this section here called repurpose first. Obviously, the one that will make that manual process so much faster is click on create clips. And basically what it's going to do is it's going to go through your entire transcript and based on the parameters you give it, it is going to pull clips for you. So you can tell it the number of clips you want it to pull. Say you want the clip duration to be something specific. You can select a layout, meaning like they have so many different templates. I do recommend that you actually set up your own templates if you use this feature. But either way, you can select a layout if you desire. And then you can also give it some instructions. So it is going to take some time to think. Again, the tool isn't super super fast, but it will pull a lot of clips for you. So you can click through each of these and kind of see what it pulled. You can discard all of them, you can keep some of them, but if you decide to keep them, they are going to live up here. It's going to pull them as new compositions for you. So again, it just took that manual process and uses AI tools to kind of assist. It also works similar for the create a highlight reel, but kind of like how I mentioned with the edit for clarity. I also think this highlight reel is better for podcast or much longer videos because it'll pull key moments throughout a much longer video. this YouTube video might kind of fit that criteria because it is a bit longer. But just know that it's going to uh you could click here, same parameters, but you can't go less than a minute. So again, I I do recommend this more for that long long long form content instead of just some short form content. And then the last one that I actually really love to use, not only for pulling clips, but also just finding key moments of things I can repurpose. So, you can click on find highlights, uh, let's say 20, and it's going to work similar to that create clips feature, but instead of pulling the clip for you, it's just going to highlight it for you. You can give it a topic, but you click submit. And what it's going to do is pull out key moments throughout your video that it thinks it is interesting. And what I will do is I will go through I'm like, ""Oh, okay. This is really cool. Maybe I can repurpose it into an Instagram carousel."" Or I scroll down. I'm like, ""Oh, I actually really like what I said here. Maybe that could be a thread."" or maybe there's something that I didn't catch manually or the create clips didn't catch at all. I'm like, ""Oh, actually, this is a really great clip. Let me actually go ahead and duplicate this to a new composition."" But either way, you have so many tools at your disposal to repurpose that content even further that leans into using some of this AI technology. Okay, I know at the beginning of the video I said I was going to give you five different features, but I have to throw a bonus one in there because Descript recently added Underlord, which is a AI based chat tool that will help you edit your videos. It's honestly like having a video editor in your back pocket, but it's as easy to use as Chat GBT. So, lately I've been playing around with this tool and I'm still a bit new to it, so I haven't fully figured everything out. And I know Descript is doing new iterations of it in the background trying to perfect this tool moving forward, but basically everything that I showed you previously, you can also do this inside of the chatbased tool almost automatically plus some. So with this chatbased tool, it's speeding my workflow up even quicker. And especially if you're newer to Descript or video editing really just isn't your strength, that's totally okay. You can lean into this chatbased tool to really help you clean and refine your video content creation workflow. I want to show you how this tool works using a client video that I actually need to go in and edit. So, instead of coming up into just the AI tools panel and starting to use all these tools, again, you can totally do that. The new Underlord feature is in this bottom right hand corner and you can come in here and you can actually ask it anything that you want. There are some prompts that are suggested for you that you are more than welcome to use. But first, I'm just going to tell it I would love your help with a rough cut or uh first round edit of this video. Then I added something like remove all the word gaps, remove filler words, and remove retakes. Basically, all those tools that I like to use, I'm just going to make Underlord do it for me. And then you let it think. Let it go. Now, again, since this is a newer tool, it does take a little bit of time to process. It might not be perfect, but again, it gives you that rough cut that you need. So, in just a matter of a few minutes, it is already done with my rough cut, and it did a pretty damn good job. So, basically, everything that I deleted up from up here is actually me coaching my client into what she's supposed to be saying. And this is where she actually starts talking. So, the script even recognized like this beginning part of the video where she actually isn't talking. It removed all of those filler words. It removed the retakes. As you can see, it went through the entire video and did some cleanup. Again, this is where I kind of coached her through some more things. And basically, it gave me that first rough cut. I personally am going to leave these in here and I will play through and watch it through on my own and then just make sure that it is fine-tuned and I will tweak it and keep moving on with my editing process. But as you can see, just in 2 minutes, it basically gave me a rough cut, a rough draft of my edit. Now, this doesn't help with just the long form content. It also helps you edit any type of short form content. So, I just pulled a clip directly from that video and I'm actually going to have it help me kind of make this a bit more engaging for social media. So, I'm going to prompt it. So, I'm going to say, I pulled a clip for YouTube to optimize for social media. Can you adjust this to a 9 by16 ratio? Add in jump cuts and B-roll where needed and apply captions. actually we'll say and apply subtitles throughout the video. And then we're going to hit go and just see what it is for us. So, as you can see, in a couple of minutes, it went ahead and added all of this scene work, which is like a very unique feature to descript where every time you see one of these, it changes like visuals. It added different B-roll clips, like even added like a little green screen. Now, it's not perfect. I would probably come in here and maybe adjust this a little bit more and refine this even further so that it fits better on like how I would naturally edit on Instagram or something like that. I would maybe make this a little bit bigger. But it applied all of this for me. I actually didn't do any of this work. It added those scenes. Maybe I would come around up here and I would maybe adjust this to fit her branding a bit more. But again, it did all of that for me. So this even applies to your short form video edits as well. I save hours upon hours upon hours by using Descript as a part of my video content creation workflow. I use it for my long- form YouTube videos. I use it for my short form content, but I also use it across my business for trainings and SOPs and workshops and course modules. Like I literally edit every single piece of video content I create inside of this tool. And at this point, years later, I actually house my entire content creation workflow inside of Descript. As you saw, I can plan, I can script, I can record inside of Descript and edit inside of Descript. So, if you're ready to speed up your video content creation workflow, head to the link in the description below so that you can try Descript today. And if you have any other questions, make sure you leave them in the comments. I might do some follow-up videos for you guys.

The days of struggling to achieve character and style consistency are gone because Google's new image editor allows you to take a single starting frame and transform it into an entire story. Your imagination really is the limit now. But if you're not using this tool correctly, you're not only missing out, you're falling behind as well. Today, I'm going to take you through my full nano banana workflow for AI film making. By the end of the video, you'll be a script writer, cinematographer, and director, all wrapped up into one. And best of all, I'm going to show you how you can achieve all of this without spending a single penny. I'm Jack. I've been a VFX artist in the advertising industry for over a decade now, and I've worked with many of the biggest brands on the planet. I've been playing with Google's new image editor for many, many hours now, and I'm really looking forward to passing on everything I've learned over to you guys in terms of how to integrate this tool into your film making workflow. And thanks to Mike for commenting and suggesting to take a deeper look at this. Of course, guys, if you do enjoy today's content, make sure to whack a like on there for me, consider subscribing, and of course, ring that bell notification icon. Let's get straight into it. So, of course, this entire process stems from our single starting image. So, it is incredibly important to get this right. You can see that I'm on midjourney. And I know already some of you guys are going to say, ""You said you could do this for free. You have to pay for midjourney."" But you can get some incredible image generations from chat GPT without spending a penny. I just love MidJourney and I recommend you guys pay for it cuz it's worth it. But here we have the starting image that I used for the short film that you see at the start of the video. Ironically, it doesn't actually feature in the video itself, but it really just served as a jumping off point and of course a style and character reference. Now, this was inspired by the movie Prometheus, if you can't already tell. And with your starting image, it is so important to lock down your tone. And I mean that both in terms of the color palette, but also just the general vibe as well, because this is going to open up into the entire film that we make with Nano Banana. Everything is born from this one starting image. So, you have to get this right. And next, it's time to start getting creative and writing our script. Now, if you're really stuck, you can employ the use of an LLM like ChatGpt, Grock, or Gemini to write out some story beats for you. But honestly guys, you want to put your own creative spin on this, right? Otherwise, where's the fun? If the entire thing is AI generated, I don't know. It's it's losing a little bit of soul, right? I feel like AI tools are best used when they are executing your own creative vision rather than just being the be all and end all. So, with that in mind, I came up with the story that you guys can see on the screen right now. And it's just written kind of similarly to a normal movie script. And I've just numbered each point to correspond with a shot. So, we'll run through these in a bit more detail in a minute when we go frame by frame. But to just give you guys the gist, I'm some kind of astronaut and I've woken up on this really strange, ancient, eerie planet. I don't know how I got there. So, there's this feeling of mystery and whilst I'm exploring it, this kind of glowing light appears from behind me and for whatever reason, I'm drawn to it. Maybe it's curiosity, maybe it's something deeper, but I have to go and look at this light. And I reach out to touch it. And when I make contact with it, I'm basically transported to a jungle planet. And of course, I just wanted to have a little bit of fun and tie it in with the nano banana theme. So, I fall out of this portal onto this massive mountain of bananas. And then the film ends with me inspecting this glass orb. And I'm just thinking, what on earth have I just discovered? All of that just came from that single starting image that we made on MidJourney. I didn't use chat GPT or anything like that. I just enjoyed writing the story. It's about having fun, right? But now that we have the script and we've started thinking about the individual frames, we can take our starting image into Nano Banana. And we're not going to go through recreating every single frame with you guys, but I can show you just one example so you can understand the process. If we do every single frame, it's going to take absolutely ages. But head on over to lmarena.ai. At the top here, you want to click direct chat. Down here, click generate images. And it's going to automatically go onto Gemini 2.5 image preview brackets nano banana, which I prefer that name. So, we're going to upload our starting image. go back to our script and let's just grab this first prompt here. In fact, it's not really a prompt. Like I said earlier, it's kind of written more like a movie script, but I'm just going to throw this at Nano Banana and just see what type of results we get back. You guys are probably aware that you can access Nano Banana on all sorts of AI sites now, like free pick for example. You can even use it on the Gemini app for completely free. However, it does come with a small diamond watermark in the right hand corner. Cheeky little workaround though. You can use the Gemini app to generate an image that you want and you can then pull it into LM Arena. Ask LM Arena using Nano Banana to remove the watermark from the bottom right hand corner which I actually did for this film. And the quite powerful thing about using Gemini instead of LM Arena is that you can combine multiple images together. And that's actually how I got the final frame of the movie. I basically took the penultimate shot, which is this one here. And I combined it with our starting shot and asked it to generate another close-up of me inspecting the orb, but in that jungle environment, and it worked really well. Like I say, pulled it into Ella Marina, got it to remove the watermark, and then we animated it on from there. Anyway, at the risk of me going off on a tangent like I always seem to do, we have got our generation back from Gemini, and it's amazing. It's actually brought the image to life in a completely different way to what you would have seen in the short film at the start of this video. So, really, you can even use Nano Banana to inspire your plot if you're running out of ideas or if you're at kind of writer's block level. just to have a little bit of fun. Let's just retry this and see what we get on a second run. See how different the variation is from our first generation. So, it's kind of similar. It's gone into a very kind of future tech vibe. I love how the kind of glowing constellations have fused with the floor, though. And I love this kind of crystalline structure over here. This massive spaceship. You can imagine you could build all of these elements into your story if you wanted to. And we'll hit retry one more time just for the fun of it. But you can see this is the process that you would use. You would take your starting image. You'd put it into Gemini or LM Marina or Freepick to access Nano Banana. You'd feed in your prompt and bit by bit you would build up essentially a story board. This one here actually I really really like. If there is any elements of the image that you don't like, you can also go back. I know with Gemini, it's very conversational. It kind of behaves a bit like an LLM, like chat GPT. So, you could say to Gemini, for example, can you remove the futuristic buildings from the scene? And it's going to give you a really nice level of control. But just look how it's put the orb next to my body. I'm kind of flat on my back here. It's completely different to what you guys would have seen in the short film. And of course the key thing is the style, the tone and myself as the character. It all feels consistent. It doesn't kind of break that illusion which I think is the problem with AI film making a lot of the time. Nano Banana essentially becomes your storyboarding mechanic where you're making each of the first frame of every shot for your film. So you can use all different types of camera angles. You can describe different elements, different actions that are taking place within the scene, but of course, it just corresponds back to the script that you've already written. So, you're not kind of plucking things out from thin air. It's following this order that you've already decided on. And like any AI tool, there's going to be a bit of trial and error. You're going to get back some pretty rubbish results from Nano Banana as well, but you can also get back something like this. And if you continually repeated the process, you would get back your entire movie except it would just be in still frames. And if we just run through here now, first of all, it's me laying on my back. I've just kind of come to in this strange sci-fi environment. Then I'm rubbing my head. Really nice establishing shot here. I love what Nano Banana did. Nice closeup. We're trying to get a variation of camera angles here. The texture that Nano Banana gets on my skin here and that kind of change of focal depth is insanely good. Like even looking at this now, it's still blowing my mind. Beautiful reflection of those glowing constellations in the lens of my glasses. Then of course we have the origin of this kind of glowing light which becomes that glass orb weird teleportation ancient device. So I'm kind of looking out over my shoulder here. We're introducing that element. Then I'm walking off into the distance because I'm drawn to this glowing sphere. I need to work out what it is. Then just a bit more variation here and also allowing me to walk towards the finishing point and then stop walking to kind of add a little bit more drama and suspense because we can't see what it is that's drawing me there, right? It's it's hidden from the frame and hidden by a glow as well. Then I knew when I typed this prompt out, this was going to be cool. but reaching out to make contact with this glowing sphere. I will admit that I think the scale is a little bit off. I would have liked the sphere to have been a bit bigger, but you know, I can't make these movies forever. I've got other stuff going on as well. So, it was a cool looking shot. I left it and moved on. And I loved the first closeup of my face so much with the constellations. I thought, wouldn't it be cool to somehow have the glow kind of lighting up my face and directly reflected in my glasses? And when this was animated, this shot looked so cool. Again, we can talk a whole bunch about the texture in my mustache and the kind of imperfections all across my nose. Imperfections are really what make things real. You really want to try and build that into your AI generations. We go onto this amazing over- the-shoulder shot of me holding this glowing glass orb and we get a little bit more textural detail, the object itself. Now, and obviously when I'm asking for this image generation from Nano Banana, we are thinking back to the script and we're thinking that it's going to engulf, you know, the glow is going to get so big that we get transported or sucked into it. And then, of course, we appear in this very different jungle environment, except I still look very consistent. My outfit still looks really consistent. I'm still holding the same glass orb and I'm just looking completely stunned like what on earth has happened. And just to finish up, we have me holding up this orb and thinking I've discovered something incredible here. So now that you have the frames for each beat of the story, it is of course time to animate. And I actually ended up using a fair few different video generators to get the end result you see at the start of the video. Lots of trial and error was involved. So guys, please don't expect it to just work out the box straight away. We're not at that point of AI video generation just yet. Of course, some tools are better than others, but I ended up using Cling, V3, and actually a whole load of Halo. I would say like 90% of the film was generated using Halo. The guys over there were very kind. They gave me a bunch of credits to test out their tools. So, if anyone's watching from Halo, thank you very much. You can kind of see me putting in various different prompts to animate all of our frames. Some of the results I got were amazing. Some of them uh were quite weird. This one, for example, where I'm walking and I just randomly turn around and I look completely different, kind of like a video game character. This one here, even though the result is cool, it isn't actually what I asked Halo to do. And obviously when I turn around to face the camera, you can see it's not very consistent uh in terms of how I actually look. My beard is a lot longer and my face structure quite different. And now this shot here, the final shot or the penultimate shot I should say where I kind of get transported on top of this mountain of bananas. My god, was this hard. And if you're sat there thinking, Jack, you said you were going to tell me how I can animate these images for free. I am. Don't worry, we're going to get to that. But I just really like to show you guys every step of the process so you can understand that this wasn't effortless. This was a lot of trial and error. A lot. You can see this generation here. I kind of fall down, which I didn't want to happen. This one here is pretty good. But then by the time we get to my face, of course, I look completely different. I haven't got glasses. And then when I was trying to get myself to fall onto the mountain of bananas, for whatever reason, uh, Halo kept changing my clothes. So, it kept taking away the astronaut outfit. What I kind of found eventually was that the image I was feeding into it was me holding the orb up like this. And so when it was trying to animate my body, because I was covering my clothing with the starting image, the AI video generators, not just Halo, I have to say, like many of them, didn't know what clothes I was wearing. And of course, you can tell it that you're wearing an astronaut suit, but it's not necessarily going to stay consistent to what we saw me wearing in the rest of the film cuz the AI video generator doesn't know. But you can see all kinds of really wacky results that we got. Again, I get changed to someone completely different. It's kind of actioning prompts that I haven't put in. I I didn't want this to happen at all. Again, here kind of a lens flare and I slide off and I've changed a lot again. And then some of them are just really crazy. Like you guys can see the amount of trial and error involved in creating that film was pretty crazy. But you do learn quite a lot along the way. This one here was really cool, unfortunately. So, I like the way that the glow happens and stuff and I kind of get sucked into it, but then it just drops in a different astronaut there that is not me. So, it kind of just breaks the entire plot, right? This one here, cool portal, but again, it's just put someone else in there. So, I think really I was pushing AI video generation to its absolute limit. But I do want to end on a high note in terms of Halo. Just look at these last couple of video generations, which of course came from this starting frame here. So, we'll go for the first generation I had, which I think ended up making it into the final short film. Really cool. Amazing changes of focal depth to really add some kind of dynamics to the shot itself. And this one here, which I don't think I used in the end, is still really, really cool. I love the way that I kind of take the orb down into the center of frame and I'm still looking at it in my face. Everything looks amazing. The way it animates my eyebrows as I kind of furrow my eyebrows. I'm trying to analyze this object. This is so good. So, yes, a lot of trial and error is involved, but if you stick with it, if you're determined and you have this kind of vision, then you're going to get some amazing results. And as I always like to say, the tools for image and video generation when it comes to AI, they're never going to get worse, are they? They are only ever going to get better. So now is the perfect time to be training yourself with these tools. That's exactly what I like to do on this channel, guys. So if you are enjoying today's content, make sure to whack a like on there for me, consider subscribing, and of course, ring that bell notification icon as well. Now, as promised, I said I was going to show you guys how you can animate your images for free. I mention this in every single one of my videos. So, if you're one of my existing subscribers, I can only apologize guys, but I want to spread the word on this tool cuz I think it's very important. The less pay walls when it comes to AI content creation in my view, the better. So, I will continue to talk about LM Marina and their Discord specifically till the end of time. I will put a link for this Discord in the description, but essentially how it works is you go into the LM Marina Discord. Of course, we already used the web-based version of LM Marina to access Nano Banana without the watermark earlier in the video. Here, we're going to jump into video arena one. That's where I hang out. If you guys ever want to see what I'm creating, you might do. Hit slash and go image to video. Then, let's just drag and drop in our establishing shot. And I want to go back to our script. And we will just grab this prompt here. Just drop it into the prompt section. And we hit return. And now we are going to wait for our generation back. See here it says this generation can take up to 10 minutes. What you're expected and encouraged to do guys is you're going to get back two different outputs from random AI video generators. And the community votes on which output they preferred left or right. So it is a lucky dip. You might get some really bad results. You are also going to get a lot of really good results. And you haven't spent a single penny. So, when I said at the start of the video, you can create what I did in terms of the short film without spending anything, you really can. I'd encourage you to use Mid Journey for your starting frame, but you could just as easily use chat GPT, for example. Write your script and then take your starting image into Nano Banana to create all your different story beats. And then you can pull those frames that Nano Banana gives you into LaMarina Discord for it to animate them for you. Now, I think you can only generate a maximum of eight videos per day. So maybe if you don't want to pay for other video generation tools, it might take you a couple of days to get the results that you're after. But you can do this. You can execute your creative vision and you haven't got to spend loads of money. And speaking of, we have actually just got our generations back from LM Marina's Discord channel. So, we'll just head on over and click here to take a little look at what we got. Let's see. Did we get lucky? That one's very nice. Nice little orbit there that it's done. Very cool. Nice parallax there between the different kind of terrain in the shot. Very, very cool. Really nice level of depth there. And let's see what we got the second time around. So, not very dynamic. Cool parallax between this kind of front layer of constellations and the back layer. I don't hate it, but it's not particularly like punchy or engaging. But again, I'll just draw you guys back to this one here. I didn't pay any money for this. The nano banana generation was free. The animation through Ella Marina's Discord was also free. And just to round off the video, guys, do not underestimate the power and effect finishing touches can have on AI content. We can talk about editing, how we cut the shots together. Do we show the entire length of a shot or just a brief snippet of it? Do we want to reverse the shot or speed it up? Maybe we want to carry out some color correction or something like that. Me personally, I like to add a whole load of film grain on top of my AI video generation just to kind of sell that textural element. And nothing really comes to life until you add music and sound effects. There are a whole load of places you can get these for free and royalty-free as well. site that I tend to use a whole load is one called Pixabay. I am on here all the time getting sound effects. And you can also go on to YouTube's music library as well, which I believe is where I actually source that opening piece of music I use in most of my YouTube videos. Here it is here, the YouTube audio library. So, you know that you haven't got to pay any money for these. And again, they are going to be copyright free, too. safe to use on YouTube and therefore safe to use across your socials as well. I say it's kind of 50/50. There is a lot of quite rubbish stuff on here. I'm going to be brutally honest, but if you do enough digging, you're going to find some cool stuff as well. Combining your sound effects and your music is really going to sell that finished product. All the elements have to come together. AI can't just do everything for you. the human element, you as a creator, is still fundamentally important to the process. And that's why AI doesn't really scare me as much as it used to because I know that a final output like the one you see at the start of the film could just not be created with AI. Could an AI have come up with the idea? Could it have tr video generations that weren't doing what I wanted it to? Could it have since checked over the nano banana exports to make sure that they were consistent enough to keep the vision alive? And could it have then searched for relevant music to create the tone that I'm after? And then all these different sound effects as well. I know V3 is quite good at that, but I really still feel we as creators are very important here. AI just gives you the tools to execute your vision in a whole new way. I really do hope you guys have enjoyed today's video. I've absolutely loved playing around with Nano Banana and the growth on this YouTube channel. It means the absolute world to me, guys. I try to read and respond to as many comments as I possibly can, but if you have any questions, and if you have ideas for future videos as well, make sure to drop them down below. Can't always respond to all the comments now, but I really do try my best. As always, if you have enjoyed today's content, make sure to like, hit that subscribe button, and of course, ring the bell notification icon so you don't miss any future videos, cuz I'm putting out as many as I possibly can. Have a great rest of your day, guys, and enjoy this new tool."

MovieFlow AI is a free AI video generator that allows creators, marketers, and educators to make professional long-form videos without paying upfront. Unlike most platforms that limit users to short 5-second clips, MovieFlow can generate cinematic videos up to 3 minutes long for free. With a built-in AI agent and ready-to-use templates, MovieFlow is quickly becoming one of the best options for free unlimited AI video generation, AI filmmaking, and automated content creation.

*What is MovieFlow AI?*
MovieFlow AI is a next-generation AI movie maker designed to make high-quality video production accessible to everyone. The tool combines text-to-video technology, creative templates, and intelligent automation. Users can generate social media clips, music videos, anime sequences, or educational tutorials with just a few prompts. The platform follows a freemium model: all users can create long-form AI videos for free with a watermark, and only pay if they want to remove the watermark for commercial use.

👉 Try MovieFlow AI for FREE today using my invite link: https://movieflow.ai/signup?inviteCode=7G60LEAQ
📺 Also check out  https://www.youtube.com/@MovieFlow_Official on YouTube for more updates. 

*Key Features*
1. Agent Mode
The built-in AI agent works like a virtual production team. Describe your idea in detail, choose video duration, aspect ratio, and language, and the AI generates your video. Users can edit results manually or ask the AI to make adjustments through chat commands.
2. Inspiration Lab
A large library of ready-to-use templates across categories such as Narrative, Commercial, Music Video, Education, 2D Anime, and 3D Anime. Templates are updated regularly to reflect current trends, such as seasonal or event-based content.
3. AI Music Video Generator
Users can create professional music videos by selecting a template, providing parameters like song length, visuals, concept, and storyline, and letting the AI generate the final result.
4. AI Ad Video Generator
The Commercial template gallery allows brands to produce user-friendly promotional videos. Simply enter a script, upload product visuals, and adjust mood and style to generate polished ads.
5. Anime Templates
MovieFlow includes specialized 2D and 3D anime templates, making it an attractive AI anime video generator. With customizable prompts and references, creators can build anime content at scale.

*Why Choose MovieFlow?*
Most AI video generators are limited in duration and require upfront payments. MovieFlow breaks this barrier by offering free long-form video generation, making it one of the most versatile options for:
1. Content creators who want social clips and storytelling content.
2. Marketers testing ad concepts with a free AI video generator.
3. Educators building engaging video lessons.
4. Filmmakers experimenting with AI filmmaking tools.
MovieFlow competes with other platforms such as Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Kling AI, and Hailuo AI, but stands out with its combination of long video duration, ease of use, and ready-to-use templates.

Google just dropped Gemini 3.0 — and it's crushing the benchmarks that matter.

This isn't another incremental update. Gemini 3.0 Pro scored 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2 (abstract reasoning) — a 9x jump from Gemini 2.5 Pro. It topped the LMArena leaderboard at 1500+ ELO, beating GPT-4 and Claude. And here's the killer feature: frame-by-frame YouTube video analysis with 1 million token context.

In this video, I show you:
✅ What makes Gemini 3.0 different (3 variants: Standard, Pro Preview, Deep Think)
✅ The benchmarks that shocked AI researchers (Humanities Last Exam, GPQA, ARC-AGI-2)
✅ Frame-by-frame video understanding—how it changes workflows for creators, educators, and devs

✅ Deep integrations: Workspace, Chrome, Android, agents that actually work
✅ Real tests I ran: video analysis, coding, research, and automation use cases

Summary ⤵️
Technical automation skills are becoming obsolete as AI advances, and the most valuable abilities in 2026 will be translating business problems into AI solutions and understanding systems-level business flows. Focus should be shifted from tool mastery to identifying high-value problems, communicating effectively with AI, and mastering systems thinking to stay ahead in the evolving economy.

If this is your first view—hi, I’m Nick! TLDR: I spent six years building automated businesses with Make.com (most notably 1SecondCopy, a content company that hit 7 figures). Today a lot of people talk about automation, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success making money with it. So this channel is me chiming in and showing you what *real* systems that make *real* revenue look like.

Hopefully I can help you improve your business, and in doing so, the rest of your life 🙏

Hey friends, in this video I’m walking you through my entire AI workflow as an entrepreneur, from how I capture ideas with tools like VoicePal and SuperWhisper, to how Claude processes all of that, and how everything comes together to Notion, Google Docs, and more. I’ll also show you exactly how I use these tools across my three main businesses (content creation, online education, and software) to save time, think better, and build faster. This video is sponsored by Anthropic, but we did approach them because my team and I use Claude every day. Hope you enjoy xx

What if I told you there's a way to build a marketing workflow that could generate $10,000 per month using nothing but AI? Most people think you need years of experience, a huge team, or some secret insider knowledge to make serious money with marketing automation. 

But here's the thing - I'm about to show you exactly how to build a vibe marketing machine that can realistically bring in five figures monthly, and you can set it up today without writing a single line of code.

I just built a complete short-form content system that takes any YouTube video and automatically transforms it into dozens of viral-ready clips. While other creators are manually editing videos for hours or paying thousands to editors, this AI workflow is generating content that's actually making money - real money.

The insane part? This automation I'm showing you is currently running in the background, creating content that drives traffic, builds audiences, and converts into actual revenue. And by the end of this video, you'll could have the complete system to build your own $10,000 per month content machine.

What you're about to see is how complete beginners are using vibe marketing to replace traditional marketing agencies and keep all the profits for themselves. We're talking about taking one piece of content and turning it into a revenue-generating engine across every platform - TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts - all working to fill your bank account while you focus on scaling.

Alright so let’s dive in!

Summary ⤵️
Learn how to build a fully automated UGC Ad Generator using n8n, Sora 2, and GPT-5 — all with no code and free templates. In this step-by-step tutorial, I’ll show you how to create an AI system that automatically generates high-quality UGC ad videos from simple product details inside a Google Sheet.

We’ll connect GPT-5 to write optimized Sora prompts, send them to the Kie API for ultra-cheap video generation (up to 6× cheaper than OpenAI’s API), and automatically update your sheet with finished video links — completely hands-off.

By the end, you’ll have your own AI-powered ad machine that creates viral-style UGC content while you sleep.

This is perfect for:
• Marketers who want to automate UGC ad production
• Agencies looking to scale creative output
• Indie founders or creators who want video ads without editing
• Anyone curious about AI-driven content generation

🛠️ Tools Used ⤵️
• n8n — No-code AI + automation builder
• Sora 2 (via Kie API) — Image-to-video generation
• GPT-5 — Optimized prompt generation
• Google Sheets — Simple interface for managing ad ideas

In this video, I show you how to build a no-code AI system in n8n that automatically creates UGC (user-generated content) ads, from product photos to full video ads. This workflow utilizes Nano Banana, Veo 3.1, and Sora 2 for image and video generation, so all you have to do is upload a product image, write a short description of the features, and tell the system what type of video you want. From there, it does everything for you, automatically generating realistic, on-brand UGC visuals and short-form videos ready to use in your marketing campaigns.

This template is completely free and incredibly easy to customize. As these AI image and video models continue to improve, you’ll be able to refine your prompts to get even better, more human-like results over time. You can generate high-quality 10-second videos for as little as $0.15 each, making it one of the most cost-effective ad creation systems available today.

Small habits are your secret weapon.
They don’t demand drastic changes.

You don’t need to overhaul your entire life to see progress.
Consistency beats intensity every single time.

Here's why:

1. Compounded impact
↳ Tiny actions add up over days, weeks, and months.
↳ Like drops of water, they carve mountains.

2. Builds unstoppable momentum
↳ Once you start, progress fuels more action.
↳ Energy grows organically, not forced.

3. Creates lasting discipline
↳ Small wins boost your confidence and commitment.
↳ Habits become a part of who you are.

4. Easier to sustain
↳ Big changes can burn you out quick.
↳ Small habits fit flexibly into your life.

5. Reduces overwhelm
↳ You're not tackling a massive challenge all at once.
↳ Breaking goals into bite-sized habits makes them doable.

Start tiny. Show up daily. Win consistently.

Most people are still using ChatGPT like it's 2023 – typing basic questions and getting basic answers – while missing the fact that ChatGPT can now act as specialized employees working 24/7.
In this video, I reveal 7 game-changing ChatGPT agents that 99% of people don't know about. These agents browse the web, schedule meetings, analyze files, create workflows, and automate hours of work every week. These agents will save you 40+ hours every week. From presentations to data analysis, competitor monitoring to content creation – everything can run on autopilot.
The difference between someone who uses ChatGPT for basic questions vs. someone who deploys agents? About 40 hours of productivity per week.

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
✅ How to activate Agent Mode in ChatGPT
✅ Build complete presentations with research, data, and design in minutes
✅ Turn raw data into interactive dashboards and executive reports
✅ Monitor competitors' pricing and strategy changes automatically
✅ Create SEO-optimized content backed by current research
✅ Build working app prototypes without writing code
✅ Automate customer support with intelligent routing
✅ Set up personal workflows that run on autopilot
