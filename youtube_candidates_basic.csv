Google just dropped Gemini 3.0 — and it's crushing the benchmarks that matter.

This isn't another incremental update. Gemini 3.0 Pro scored 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2 (abstract reasoning) — a 9x jump from Gemini 2.5 Pro. It topped the LMArena leaderboard at 1500+ ELO, beating GPT-4 and Claude. And here's the killer feature: frame-by-frame YouTube video analysis with 1 million token context.

In this video, I show you:
✅ What makes Gemini 3.0 different (3 variants: Standard, Pro Preview, Deep Think)
✅ The benchmarks that shocked AI researchers (Humanities Last Exam, GPQA, ARC-AGI-2)
✅ Frame-by-frame video understanding—how it changes workflows for creators, educators, and devs
✅ AI Mode in Search + generative interfaces (dynamic UIs built on the fly)
✅ Antigravity IDE—Google's new AI-first coding environment
✅ Deep integrations: Workspace, Chrome, Android, agents that actually work
✅ Real tests I ran: video analysis, coding, research, and automation use cases
✅ Should you switch from ChatGPT/Claude? (Honest breakdown)

If you're creating content, building tools, or just trying to keep up with AI without drowning in hype—this is the breakdown you need.

Summary ⤵️
Technical automation skills are becoming obsolete as AI advances, and the most valuable abilities in 2026 will be translating business problems into AI solutions and understanding systems-level business flows. Focus should be shifted from tool mastery to identifying high-value problems, communicating effectively with AI, and mastering systems thinking to stay ahead in the evolving economy.

If this is your first view—hi, I’m Nick! TLDR: I spent six years building automated businesses with Make.com (most notably 1SecondCopy, a content company that hit 7 figures). Today a lot of people talk about automation, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success making money with it. So this channel is me chiming in and showing you what *real* systems that make *real* revenue look like.

Hopefully I can help you improve your business, and in doing so, the rest of your life 🙏

Want to create high-quality YouTube videos in just a few hours instead of a few days? In this video, I walk you through five powerful AI workflows that speed up your entire content creation process — from idea to final upload.
These are the same systems I use to stay consistent without burning out and they’ll help you make better videos faster, even if you’re short on time or resources.
If you want to grow on YouTube and attract real clients, this is the video to watch.

🎬 Perfect YouTube Script Formula video: https://youtu.be/h8HlzJFJ-3k?si=0QN9Ca9pJRJ4xxGO

👉Prompt 1:
""I want you to help me come up with YouTube topics and titles that are perfectly aligned with what I charge money for — but also based on what people are actually searching for on YouTube.

Here’s what I need you to balance for me:

The topics must directly connect to my services or the problems I solve for clients.

The keyword phrases need to come from real YouTube searches with enough volume to be worth targeting.

The finished titles should use those same keyword phrases but add a bit of curiosity or emotional pull that makes people want to click.

Before you start, here’s what you need to know about me:

My business: [describe what you sell]

My ideal clients: [describe who they are]

What I help them with: [list the main services or problems you solve]

Now, go to YouTube and find the best keyword phrases related to this business and audience. Make sure they have real search intent and aren’t too broad.

Give me the results in two columns:

Column A: The actual keyword phrase people search for

Column B: A strong, clickable YouTube title that includes that phrase and adds some intrigue

Only include ideas that could realistically help a new channel build authority in this niche. You can give me as many ideas as I ask for (for example, 10 or 52 if I want a year’s worth).

Everything should be based on real research, not guesses.""

👉Prompt 2:
“I’m planning a full video about [FILL IN THE BLANK] I already know I want to include the following: [BRAIN DUMP EVERYTHING HERE]

Please do enough deep research to fill in any gaps in my research and inclusions. More specifically, I’d like to see [A FEW MORE TIPS/HELP ME MAKE THIS ARGUMENT/HELP ME ESTABLISH THIS OPINION/REAL WORLD CASE STUDIES/STATISTICS] 

DO NOT take any irrelevant side-quests or tangents along the way. Keep it tight and focused.”

👉CustomGPT Instructions:
""You are my YouTube script-writing assistant.
Use my script formula and writing sample to create new scripts based on the concept, notes, and research I provide.
Follow my formula’s structure and tone exactly, arranging ideas in the most logical order for the viewer.
Eliminate repeated points, simplify complex ideas, and make every line easy to follow and conversational—like natural spoken dialogue.
Each time I start a new script, I’ll give you my concept, notes, and research to begin writing.""

Join me as I chat with Dan Koe where he shares his content creation system that allows him to efficiently produce high-quality content across multiple platforms. He explains how he uses Twitter as a testing ground for ideas, then repurposes successful content for newsletters, YouTube videos, and other social platforms. Dan demonstrates how he uses AI tools to research topics, generate content ideas, and analyze successful content structures without sacrificing his unique voice and perspective.

32:20 - Creating Viral Content with AI (Prompt Breakdown)

*Dan uses SuperX. Link: https://superx.so/?via=community

Key Points:
• Dan uses a systematic approach to content creation, starting with Twitter posts to validate ideas before expanding to other platforms
• He leverages AI tools (primarily Claude and ChatGPT) to research, summarize, and generate content ideas
• His weekly workflow includes writing newsletters that become YouTube videos, and creating 2-3 social media posts daily
• Dan uses specific AI prompts to analyze high-performing content and create frameworks for replicating successful formats

1) The Content Ecosystem Framework

Dan's entire content machine runs on just TWO core activities:
• ONE weekly newsletter (sometimes twice)
• 2-3 social media posts DAILY

He writes for Twitter FIRST (280 char limit) then repurposes EVERYWHERE:
• Threads
• Instagram
• LinkedIn
• YouTube scripts
• Reels/TikTok

2) The Newsletter Research Hack

Dan doesn't spend hours taking notes from research. Instead:

• Finds YouTube videos on his topic
• Uses Gemini 2.5 to summarize HOURS of content into digestible notes
• Has AI compare with his previous content to find connections
• Creates an outline from these insights

This turns 6+ hours of research into 1000 focused words!

3) The Idea Validation System

How does Dan know what to write about? Two brilliant approaches:

1. Use Twitter as a testing ground - when a tweet performs well, expand it into a newsletter
2. Study what ALREADY works - find top-performing YouTube videos in your niche, take the TOPIC (not the content), add your unique perspective

4) The AI Content Multiplier

After writing his newsletter, Dan runs it through THREE custom prompts:

• YouTube title generator (creates 20-30 titles based on his best performers)
• Deep post generator (extracts paradoxes, quotes, transformation arcs)
• Content ideas generator (60 ideas based on his top-performing formats)

5) The Daily Content Routine

Dan's productivity system is SHOCKINGLY simple:

• 2 hours of focused writing each morning
• Must complete one newsletter section
• Must write three social posts
• Schedule everything across platforms

That's it. Two hours daily = millions of followers across platforms.

6) The Follower Growth Formula
1. Experiment until you find a post type that generates followers
2. Create consistent ""spin-offs"" of that format (30% of content)
3. Use remaining 70% to experiment for the NEXT winning format
4. Cycle out older formats as new ones emerge

7) The AI Post Deconstruction Technique
1. Find posts you admire
2. Ask AI: ""Break down the structure of this post so I can recreate it""
3. Do this for 3 different posts
4. Have AI combine them into a ""complete guide""
5. Ask what context it needs from YOU
6. Create a custom prompt that interviews you then writes in that style

8) The Prompt Engineering Secret

Dan uses a ""prompt that helps create better prompts"" approach:
- First, get AI to break down what makes great content work
- Then, create a two-phase prompt:
    - Phase 1: Interview you for context
    - Phase 2: Generate content based on your answer

What if I told you there's a way to build a marketing workflow that could generate $10,000 per month using nothing but AI? Most people think you need years of experience, a huge team, or some secret insider knowledge to make serious money with marketing automation. 

But here's the thing - I'm about to show you exactly how to build a vibe marketing machine that can realistically bring in five figures monthly, and you can set it up today without writing a single line of code.

I just built a complete short-form content system that takes any YouTube video and automatically transforms it into dozens of viral-ready clips. While other creators are manually editing videos for hours or paying thousands to editors, this AI workflow is generating content that's actually making money - real money.

The insane part? This automation I'm showing you is currently running in the background, creating content that drives traffic, builds audiences, and converts into actual revenue. And by the end of this video, you'll could have the complete system to build your own $10,000 per month content machine.

What you're about to see is how complete beginners are using vibe marketing to replace traditional marketing agencies and keep all the profits for themselves. We're talking about taking one piece of content and turning it into a revenue-generating engine across every platform - TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts - all working to fill your bank account while you focus on scaling.

Alright so let’s dive in!

Small habits are your secret weapon.
They don’t demand drastic changes.

You don’t need to overhaul your entire life to see progress.
Consistency beats intensity every single time.

Here's why:

1. Compounded impact
↳ Tiny actions add up over days, weeks, and months.
↳ Like drops of water, they carve mountains.

2. Builds unstoppable momentum
↳ Once you start, progress fuels more action.
↳ Energy grows organically, not forced.

3. Creates lasting discipline
↳ Small wins boost your confidence and commitment.
↳ Habits become a part of who you are.

4. Easier to sustain
↳ Big changes can burn you out quick.
↳ Small habits fit flexibly into your life.

5. Reduces overwhelm
↳ You're not tackling a massive challenge all at once.
↳ Breaking goals into bite-sized habits makes them doable.

Start tiny. Show up daily. Win consistently.
